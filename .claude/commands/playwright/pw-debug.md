Debug browser errors or issues using the playwright-specialist agent.

Usage: /pw-debug "description of the issue"

Example: /pw-debug "login button not responding to clicks"

The agent will:
1. Reproduce the issue in browser
2. Capture console logs and errors
3. Check event listeners
4. Analyze DOM state
5. Test different scenarios
6. Identify root cause
7. Suggest and verify fixes

This is your go-to command when users report UI issues!
