Check for JavaScript console errors on the current page or component using the playwright-specialist agent.

The agent will:
1. Navigate to the page/component
2. Capture all console output (errors, warnings, logs)
3. Analyze error patterns
4. Suggest fixes for common issues
5. Report any design system violations detected

Use this after making changes to catch runtime errors early!
