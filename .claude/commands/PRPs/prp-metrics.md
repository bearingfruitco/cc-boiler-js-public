# PRP Metrics Tracking

Measure PRP effectiveness and improve over time.

## Usage
```bash
/prp-metrics [prp-name]        # Show metrics for specific PRP
/prp-metrics --summary         # Show overall summary
/prp-metrics --export          # Export metrics as JSON
/prp-metrics --leaderboard     # Show most successful PRPs
```

## Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## What It Does

Tracks and analyzes key metrics for PRP success:

1. **First-Pass Success Rate**
   - Did the implementation work on first attempt?
   - No major revisions needed
   - All validation levels passed

2. **Time to Completion**
   - Total time from start to PR
   - Time per validation level
   - Comparison to estimates

3. **Validation Performance**
   - Pass/fail rate per level
   - Common failure points
   - Fix time for failures

4. **Post-Implementation Quality**
   - Bugs found after PR
   - Performance metrics
   - Test coverage achieved

## Analytics Insights

The system automatically identifies:

1. **Common Failure Patterns**
   - Most frequent validation failures
   - Typical fix requirements
   - Time to resolution

2. **Template Effectiveness**
   - Success rate by template type
   - Which templates need updates
   - Missing pattern coverage

3. **Developer Patterns**
   - Peak productivity times
   - Common mistakes
   - Learning curve progression

## Improvement Actions

Based on metrics, the system suggests:

1. **Update Templates**
   - Add missing patterns
   - Clarify ambiguous sections
   - Include new gotchas

2. **Enhance AI Docs**
   - Document repeated issues
   - Add solution patterns
   - Update examples

3. **Adjust Estimates**
   - Refine time predictions
   - Update complexity ratings
   - Calibrate expectations

## Integration

Metrics are automatically collected:
- During `/prp-execute` runs
- From validation results
- Via post-implementation tracking

No additional work needed - just execute PRPs normally!

## Tips

1. Review metrics weekly
2. Update templates based on failures
3. Share successful patterns
4. Track trends over time
5. Celebrate improvements!
