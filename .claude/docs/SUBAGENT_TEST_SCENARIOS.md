### 15. PII Guardian (`pii`)
**Test Scenario**: Scan for PII exposure
```bash
pii scan codebase for exposed personal information and suggest remediation

# Expected: PII audit report with compliance recommendations
```

## üîÑ Workflow Chain Tests

### Security Audit Chain
```bash
chain security-audit-chain

# Expected: 
# 1. Security analysis by security-threat-analyst
# 2. Code path tracing by code-analyzer-debugger
# 3. API fixes by backend-reliability-engineer
# 4. Documentation by documentation-writer
```

### Feature Development Chain
```bash
chain feature-development-chain

# Expected:
# 1. Planning phase with PM, architect, QA
# 2. Implementation with TDD, frontend, backend
# 3. Review with code-reviewer, security, performance
```

## üéØ Integration Tests

### Test 1: File Context Suggestions
1. Create a file: `components/UserCard.tsx`
2. Edit the file
3. **Expected**: System suggests `fe` (frontend-ux-specialist)

### Test 2: Security File Detection
1. Create a file: `api/auth/login.ts`
2. Edit the file
3. **Expected**: System suggests `sec` (security-threat-analyst)

### Test 3: Workflow Transition
1. Use: `qa create tests for checkout`
2. Complete the agent task
3. **Expected**: System suggests `tdd` for implementation

### Test 4: Alias Usage
```bash
# Test each primary alias
fe build navbar
be create user API
qa test checkout
sec audit auth
tdd implement search
cr review changes
doc update README
pm coordinate feature
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Each agent should:
1. Understand its domain expertise
2. Follow system conventions
3. Produce high-quality output
4. Integrate with other agents
5. Respect design system rules
