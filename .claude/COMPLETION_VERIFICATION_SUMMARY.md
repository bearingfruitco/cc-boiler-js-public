# Completion Verification System - Implementation Summary

## What We've Implemented

### 1. **New Hook: 14-completion-verifier.py**
- Location: `.claude/hooks/post-tool-use/14-completion-verifier.py`
- Detects completion claims ("done", "complete", "finished", etc.)
- Runs TDD-focused verification checks
- Non-blocking (uses stdout for guidance)
- Tracks metrics in verification manifest

### 2. **New Command: /verify**
- Location: `.claude/commands/verify.md`
- Manual verification command
- Quick mode: Tests exist, TypeScript compiles
- Full mode: Includes coverage and regression
- TDD workflow integration

### 3. **Updated Commands**
- **process-tasks.md**: Added TDD verification step
- **feature-complete.md**: Added verification requirement before completion

### 4. **Configuration Updates**
- **config.json**: Added `verification_system` settings
- **settings.json**: Activated the new hook
- **verification-manifest.json**: Created for tracking metrics

### 5. **Documentation**
- Updated hooks README with new hook description
- Created migration guide
- Added test script for validation

## How It Works

1. **Detection Phase**
   - Hook monitors Respond tool output
   - Detects completion phrases
   - Extracts feature/task context

2. **Verification Phase**
   - Checks if tests exist (TDD compliance)
   - Runs tests if they exist
   - Checks TypeScript compilation
   - Tracks whether tests were written first

3. **Guidance Phase**
   - Provides TDD-focused guidance
   - Suggests next steps
   - Non-blocking to maintain flow

## Integration Points

### With TDD Workflow
- Enhances existing TDD enforcer
- Works with test-auto-runner
- Promotes test-first development

### With Process Tasks
- Automatic verification on task completion
- Shows TDD status for each task
- Task indicators: [âœ“] verified, [âœ—] failed, [ðŸ§ª] tests needed

### With Feature Complete
- Requires verification before marking complete
- Runs tests and TypeScript checks
- Prevents false completion

## Metrics Tracked

```json
{
  "tdd_metrics": {
    "tests_written_first": 0,
    "tests_written_after": 0,
    "completion_claims_verified": 0,
    "completion_claims_failed": 0
  }
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/test-completion-verifier.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Usage**: Watch for completion claims in real workflows
2. **Adjust Phrases**: Add/remove completion phrases based on usage
3. **Refine Guidance**: Improve TDD guidance messages
4. **Consider Strict Mode**: After testing, consider enabling blocking mode

## Benefits

1. **Catches False Completions**: No more "done" without verification
2. **Promotes TDD**: Guides toward test-first development
3. **Non-Disruptive**: Provides guidance without blocking
4. **Metrics**: Tracks TDD compliance over time
5. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing tools

The system is now active and will provide TDD guidance whenever Claude claims something is complete!
