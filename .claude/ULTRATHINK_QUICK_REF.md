# 🚀 UltraThink & Visual Planning Quick Reference

## 🤯 NEW: Automatic Thinking Enhancement

Your regular commands now **automatically** get enhanced thinking when needed!

### How It Works
1. **Complexity Analysis** - Every command is scored 1-10
2. **Auto Enhancement** - Complex tasks get thinking instructions
3. **Smart Agents** - Very complex tasks (7+) spawn parallel agents

### Examples
```bash
# Simple stays simple ✅
/cc Button                    # No change needed

# Medium gets enhanced 🤔
/prd "user dashboard"         # → /prd [Think carefully] "user dashboard"

# Complex gets UltraThink 🤯
/refactor "10 files"          # → [UltraThink deeply]: /refactor...
                             # → Spawns 3 parallel agents!
```

### Automatic Triggers
- `/prd`, `/prp` - Always enhanced
- `/generate-tasks` - Gets step-by-step thinking
- 5+ files - Triggers deeper analysis
- Keywords: refactor, architecture, migrate, optimize

## New Commands

### 🧠 Ultra Think
```bash
/ut "complex task"
/ultra-think "analyze this deeply"
```
- 32k+ token thinking window
- Auto-spawns parallel agents
- Each agent gets 128-256k context
- Synthesizes multiple perspectives

### 📸 Visual Planning  
```bash
/vp "UI issue description"
/visual-plan "fix layout problems"
```
- Drag & drop screenshots
- Iterative planning ("keep planning")
- Auto design system checking
- Mobile/tablet consideration

## When to Use

### Use UltraThink For:
- 🏗️ Architecture decisions
- 🔄 Complex refactoring (5+ files)
- 🐛 Tricky debugging
- ⚡ Performance optimization
- 🔒 Security analysis

### Use Visual Planning For:
- 🎨 UI/UX improvements
- 📱 Responsive issues
- 🖼️ Visual bugs
- 📊 Layout problems
- 🎯 Design compliance

## Auto-Triggers

Parallel agents spawn automatically when:
- Using `/ut` or `/vp` commands
- Task mentions: refactor, architecture, optimize, migrate
- Working with 5+ files
- Screenshots provided
- Complex debugging scenarios

## Agent Types

### UI/UX Agents
- Design Analyst
- Pattern Researcher  
- Accessibility Reviewer

### Architecture Agents
- System Analyst
- Performance Optimizer
- Security Reviewer

### Debug Agents
- Root Cause Analyst
- Pattern Reviewer
- Solution Researcher

### Refactor Agents
- Dependency Mapper
- Impact Analyzer
- Migration Planner

## Workflow Examples

### Complex UI Fix
```bash
/vp "dashboard cluttered on mobile"
# Drag screenshots
# "keep planning - ensure tablet works too"
# Agents analyze → Synthesize → Implement
```

### Architecture Planning
```bash
/ut "plan GraphQL migration"
# Auto-spawns 3 specialists
# Each analyzes independently
# Comprehensive plan generated
```

### Debug with Evidence
```bash
/ut "forms slow on mobile" --visual
# Drag performance screenshots
# Agents analyze DOM, network, bundle
# Root cause + fix proposed
```

## Integration with Existing

### Enhanced PRD Flow
```bash
/prd → /ut "analyze PRD" → /gt → /pt
```

### Visual Bug Fix
```bash
/bt add "layout issue" → /vp → implement
```

## Tips from Ray Fernando

1. **"YOLO"** - Sometimes just try it
2. **Plan First** - Get plan right before code
3. **Screenshot Everything** - Visual evidence
4. **Iterate** - "Keep planning" until happy
5. **Trust Agents** - Let them work

## Quick Aliases

- `ut` → ultra-think
- `vp` → visual-plan
- `deep-think` → ultra-think
- `visual` → visual-plan
