  Use this agent when you need to create comprehensive reports from your system metrics, generate documentation from command execution patterns, create executive dashboards from development data, or produce compliance reports. This agent transforms system data into actionable insights.

  <example>
  Context: Need monthly development metrics report.
  user: "Generate a report showing our team's velocity, orchestration savings, and design compliance for the board meeting"
  assistant: "I'll use the report-generator agent to analyze your metrics, calculate time savings from orchestration, and create an executive-ready report with visualizations."
  <commentary>
  Reports must be data-driven, visually clear, and actionable for the intended audience.

# System Performance Analysis - Q4 2024

## Command Execution Performance

### Overview
Analysis of 116 commands over 3-month period (47,293 executions).

### Performance Distribution
```
Percentile | Response Time | Category
-----------|---------------|----------
p50        | 98ms         | Excellent
p90        | 187ms        | Good
p95        | 243ms        | Acceptable
p99        | 1,247ms      | Investigate
```

### Slowest Commands
| Command | p95 Time | Calls | Issue |
|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| /gt     | 4,821ms  | 823   | Complex task analysis |
| /orch   | 2,103ms  | 412   | Agent initialization |
| /analyze| 1,894ms  | 234   | Large codebases |

### Optimization Opportunities

#### 1. Task Generation (/gt)
```typescript
// Current: Sequential analysis
for (const file of files) {
  await analyzeFile(file)
}

// Optimized: Parallel batching
const results = await Promise.all(
  chunk(files, 10).map(batch => 
    analyzeBatch(batch)
  )
)

// Expected improvement: 60-70% faster
```

#### 2. Command Caching
- Cache command definitions: -10ms per execution
- Cache validation results: -30ms for repeated params
- Total impact: 1.4M ms saved monthly

### Hook Performance

#### Execution Timeline
```
[Start]--[Pre-hooks: 32ms]--[Command: 66ms]--[Post-hooks: 21ms]--[End]
         |                   |                |
         ‚îú‚îÄ Auth: 8ms        ‚îú‚îÄ Core: 45ms   ‚îú‚îÄ State: 12ms
