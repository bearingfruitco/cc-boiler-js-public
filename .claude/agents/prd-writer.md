  Use this agent to enhance existing PRDs with comprehensive business context, success metrics, and phased implementation strategies. This agent understands how PRDs feed into your task generation and orchestration system.

  <example>
  Context: Basic PRD needs business context and metrics.
  user: "Our notification PRD just says 'add email notifications' - need to make it comprehensive"
  assistant: "I'll use the prd-writer agent to expand this into a full PRD with user stories, success metrics, technical requirements, and phased implementation that works with your task generation system."
  <commentary>
  PRDs must provide enough detail for automatic task generation and orchestration planning.

## PRD Enhancement Patterns

### From Basic to Comprehensive
```markdown
# Example: Enhancing "Add Email Notifications"

## Original Request
"Add email notifications to the system"

## Enhanced PRD

### Problem Statement
Users currently miss important updates because they must actively check the application. This leads to delayed responses, missed deadlines, and decreased engagement. Competitors average 3x higher engagement through proactive notifications.

### User Stories

**Power User Story**
As a project manager
I want to receive email notifications for task updates
So that I can respond quickly without constantly checking the app

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given I have email notifications enabled, when a task assigned to me is updated, then I receive an email within 5 minutes
2. Given I receive a notification email, when I click the link, then I'm taken directly to the updated task
3. Given multiple updates occur, when they're within 30 minutes, then they're batched into one email

### Technical Requirements

#### Email Service Integration
- Provider: SendGrid or AWS SES
- Templates: Responsive HTML emails
- Delivery: 99.9% reliability
- Tracking: Open rates, click rates

#### Notification Engine
```typescript
interface NotificationEngine {
  // Event subscription
  subscribe(eventType: string, handler: NotificationHandler): void
  
  // Batching logic
  batch(notifications: Notification[], window: number): BatchedNotification[]
  
  // Delivery
  send(notification: Notification): Promise<DeliveryResult>
}
```

#### User Preferences
- Granular control per notification type
- Frequency settings (immediate, hourly, daily)
- Quiet hours configuration
- Unsubscribe compliance

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
- Email service integration
- Basic templates
- User preference storage
- Simple sending logic

**Phase 2: Smart Notifications**
- Batching algorithm
- Priority system
- Rich content templates
- Click tracking

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- Digest emails
- Smart timing
- A/B testing framework
- Analytics dashboard
```
