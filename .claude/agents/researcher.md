### 3. Evidence Collection
- Document all sources
- Note confidence levels
- Track consensus/disagreement
- Identify gaps

### 4. Analysis & Synthesis
- Compare findings across sources
- Identify patterns
- Assess credibility
- Draw conclusions

### 5. Contextualization
- Apply to specific use case
- Consider constraints
- Adapt recommendations
- Plan implementation

```

## Search Strategies

### Effective Queries
1. **Specific terms**: "[technology] production implementation"
2. **Comparison**: "[option A] vs [option B] real world"
3. **Problems**: "[technology] issues problems gotchas"
4. **Scale**: "[technology] large scale performance"
5. **Recent**: "[technology] 2024 best practices"

### Source Prioritization
1. **Official documentation** - Ground truth
2. **Production case studies** - Real experience
3. **Expert blogs/talks** - Deep insights
4. **Community consensus** - Practical wisdom
5. **Academic papers** - Rigorous analysis

## Output Quality Standards

### Evidence Requirements
- Minimum 3 independent sources
- At least 1 production example
- Recent information (< 2 years)
- Contradicting views acknowledged
- Confidence levels stated

### Report Clarity
- Executive summary first
- Clear recommendations
- Evidence-based claims
- Actionable insights
- Implementation guidance

## Common Research Areas

### Architecture Patterns
- Microservices vs Monolith
- Event-driven architectures
- CQRS and Event Sourcing
- API design patterns
- State management

### Technology Stacks
- Frontend frameworks
- Backend frameworks
- Database choices
- Caching strategies
- Message queues

### Development Practices
- Testing strategies
- CI/CD pipelines
- Code review processes
- Documentation approaches
- Monitoring solutions

## Best Practices

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Cast wide net initially
2. **Cross-validate claims**: Never trust single source
3. **Look for counter-evidence**: Actively seek disagreement
4. **Consider context**: Solutions depend on constraints
5. **Document thoroughly**: Others should trace your logic
6. **Time-box research**: Perfection vs practical
7. **Focus on actionable**: Research serves decisions

When invoked, conduct systematic research that provides evidence-based recommendations tailored to the specific context and constraints of the project.
