- Multiple sources for validation
- Consider system constraints
- Practical over theoretical
- Document all sources
- Update knowledge base

## Research Patterns

### Technical Solution Research
```markdown
# Research: Real-Time Collaboration Implementation

## Research Questions
1. What algorithms enable real-time collaborative editing?
2. How do leading products handle conflict resolution?
3. What infrastructure is required at scale?
4. How does this integrate with our command system?

## Methodology
- Academic papers review (10 papers)
- Open-source implementation analysis (5 projects)
- Product teardowns (Google Docs, Notion, Figma)
- Performance benchmarks
- Security considerations

## Key Findings

### 1. Algorithm Comparison
| Algorithm | Complexity | Latency | Conflict Resolution | Use Case |
|-----------|------------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| OT (Operational Transform) | High | Low | Centralized | Google Docs |
| CRDTs | Medium | Very Low | Automatic | Figma, Notion |
| Diff-Sync | Low | Medium | Manual | Simple text |

**Evidence**: 
- Paper: "A Comprehensive Study of CRDTs" (Shapiro et al., 2011)
- Benchmark: Y.js performance tests show <50ms sync time

### 2. Implementation Analysis

#### Google Docs Approach
```typescript
// Operational Transform pattern
class GoogleDocsOT {
  // Centralized server coordinates all operations
  // Clients send operations to server
  // Server transforms and broadcasts
  // Requires stable connection
}
```
Source: "How Google Docs Works" engineering blog

#### Figma Approach
```typescript
// CRDT-based with custom optimizations
class FigmaCRDT {
  // Each client has full CRDT
  // Peer-to-peer sync possible
  // Eventual consistency guaranteed
  // Works offline
}
```

### 3. Infrastructure Requirements

**WebSocket Server**
- Handles 10k+ concurrent connections
- Sub-100ms message routing
- Horizontal scaling required

**State Persistence**
- Operation log storage
- Snapshot optimization
- Conflict history

**Performance Metrics** (from production systems)
- Figma: 16ms average sync latency
- Notion: 30-50ms for text, 100ms for blocks
- Google Docs: 20-30ms with good connection

## Integration with Your System

### Proposed Architecture
```typescript
// Integrate with command system
export class CollaborativeCommand implements Command {
  name = 'collaborate'
  
  async execute(params: CollabParams, context: CommandContext) {
    // Initialize CRDT for document
    const doc = new Y.Doc()
    
    // Connect to collaboration server
    const provider = new WebsocketProvider(
      'wss://collab.yourapp.com',
      params.documentId,
      doc
    )
    
    // Sync with GitHub state
    await this.syncToGist(doc, context)
    
    // Return collaboration session
    return {
      sessionId: provider.roomname,
      document: doc,
      awareness: provider.awareness
    }
  }
}
```

### State Management Strategy
```yaml
Real-time State: Y.js CRDT in memory
Persistence: GitHub Gists for snapshots
Hybrid Approach:
  - Live edits in CRDT
  - Periodic snapshots to Gist
  - Full history in Gist commits
  
Benefits:
  - No additional database needed
  - Version control built-in
  - Aligns with existing patterns
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Use Y.js for CRDT Implementation
**Reasons**:
- Production-proven (used by Notion, Gitbook)
- Excellent performance benchmarks
- Active community and maintenance
- MIT licensed

**Trade-offs**:
- Learning curve for CRDT concepts
- 200KB client bundle size
- Requires WebSocket infrastructure

### 2. Implement Phased Rollout
**Phase 1**: Text collaboration only
- Lower complexity
- Prove infrastructure
- Gather usage metrics

**Phase 2**: Rich content blocks
- Add complex types
- Performance optimization
- Scale infrastructure

**Phase 3**: Full document model
- Complete feature parity
- Advanced conflict resolution
- Offline support

### 3. Infrastructure Setup
```yaml
Recommended Stack:
  WebSocket: Socket.io with Redis adapter
  CRDT: Y.js with y-websocket
  Persistence: GitHub Gists + CDN cache
  Monitoring: Real-time latency tracking
  
Estimated Costs:
  - 1k users: $200/month
  - 10k users: $1,500/month
  - 100k users: $8,000/month
```

### Pattern Analysis Research
```markdown
# Research: Orchestration Patterns in Modern Development

## Objective
Analyze orchestration patterns to improve our multi-agent system efficiency.

## Sources Analyzed
- Kubernetes orchestration patterns
- Apache Airflow DAG designs  
- GitHub Actions workflow patterns
- Temporal workflow patterns
- Academic papers on distributed systems

## Key Patterns Identified

### 1. Pipeline Pattern
```yaml
Pattern: Sequential stages with parallel tasks
Usage: Build → Test → Deploy pipelines
Efficiency: 40-60% time reduction

Application to Our System:
  Phase 1: [Analysis Tasks] - Parallel
  Phase 2: [Implementation Tasks] - Parallel
  Phase 3: [Integration Tasks] - Sequential
```

### 2. Fan-Out/Fan-In
```yaml
Pattern: Distribute work, then consolidate
Usage: Map-reduce operations
Efficiency: Linear scaling with workers

Our Implementation:
  Fan-Out: Distribute to domain agents
  Process: Independent execution
  Fan-In: Consolidate results
```

### 3. Circuit Breaker
```yaml
Pattern: Fail fast with recovery
Usage: Handling unreliable services
Benefit: System resilience

For Commands:
  - Track failure rates
  - Open circuit at threshold
  - Periodic retry attempts
```

## Comparative Analysis

| System | Pattern | Parallel Efficiency | Use Case |
|--------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Kubernetes | Declarative | 85-95% | Container orchestration |
| Airflow | DAG-based | 70-80% | Data pipelines |
| GitHub Actions | Event-driven | 60-70% | CI/CD workflows |
| Our System | Hybrid | 75-85% | Development tasks |

## Recommendations

1. **Adopt DAG visualization** for complex workflows
2. **Implement circuit breakers** for external services
3. **Add workflow templates** for common patterns
4. **Create orchestration metrics** dashboard
```

### Security Research
```markdown
# Research: Secure State Management in Distributed Systems

## Context
Our system uses GitHub Gists for state management. Research security implications and best practices.

## Findings

### 1. Threat Model
```yaml
Identified Threats:
  - Public Gist exposure
  - State tampering
  - Replay attacks
  - Information disclosure
  
Mitigations:
  - Encryption at rest
  - Signed state updates
  - Timestamp validation
  - PII scrubbing
```

### 2. Industry Approaches

**HashiCorp Vault**
- Encrypted key-value store
- Dynamic secrets
- Audit logging
Pattern: Centralized secrets with lease management

**Kubernetes Secrets**
- Base64 encoded (not encrypted)
- RBAC controlled
- Encrypted at rest in etcd
Pattern: Namespace isolation with RBAC

**AWS Parameter Store**
- Encrypted with KMS
- Version history
- IAM policies
Pattern: Hierarchical with versioning

### 3. Recommended Implementation
```typescript
export class SecureGistState {
  private key: CryptoKey
  
  async saveState(data: any) {
    // Remove PII
    const cleaned = this.sanitizer.clean(data)
    
    // Sign data
    const signature = await this.sign(cleaned)
    
    // Encrypt sensitive fields
    const encrypted = await this.encryptSensitive(cleaned)
    
    // Save with metadata
    await this.gist.update({
      data: encrypted,
      signature,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      version: this.getVersion()
    })
  }
  
  async loadState() {
    const raw = await this.gist.load()
    
    // Verify signature
    if (!await this.verify(raw)) {
      throw new SecurityError('State tampering detected')
    }
    
    // Check timestamp
    if (this.isExpired(raw.timestamp)) {
      throw new SecurityError('State expired')
    }
    
    // Decrypt and return
    return this.decryptSensitive(raw.data)
  }
}
```
