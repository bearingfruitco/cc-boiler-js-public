# Claude Code Boilerplate System Overview v2.3.6

## üéØ Executive Summary

This is a comprehensive AI-assisted development system that combines PRD-driven development, automated quality enforcement, persistent context management, seamless team collaboration, and async event-driven architecture. It treats specifications as the primary development artifact, following Sean Grove's vision of "The New Code."

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Command System (95+ Commands)
- **Context Management**: Smart resume, checkpoints, context profiles
- **PRD Workflow**: Specification-driven development with clarity linting
- **Development**: Component creation, design validation, bug tracking
- **Async Operations**: Event handlers, parallel processing, loading states
- **Testing**: Browser automation, unit tests, PRD-based test generation
- **Collaboration**: Multi-agent orchestration, GitHub integration
- **Grading**: Implementation alignment scoring

#### 2. Hooks System (Automated Enforcement)
**Pre-Tool-Use Hooks**:
- Smart auto-approval (safe operations proceed without interruption)
- Design system enforcement (blocks violations)
- Async pattern detection (warns about anti-patterns)
- PRD clarity linting (catches ambiguous language)
- GitHub synchronization (prevents conflicts)
- Security checks (PII protection)
- Truth enforcement (protects established values)

**Post-Tool-Use Hooks**:
- Auto-save to GitHub gists every 60s
- Pattern extraction from successful implementations
- Event metrics tracking
- Performance monitoring

#### 3. PRD-Driven Development
```
PROJECT IDEA ‚Üí PROJECT PRD ‚Üí GITHUB ISSUES ‚Üí FEATURE PRDS ‚Üí ASYNC REQUIREMENTS ‚Üí TASKS ‚Üí CODE ‚Üí PR ‚Üí DEPLOY
```
- Specifications are the primary artifact
- Async requirements documented upfront
- Clear acceptance criteria become executable tests
- Implementation graded against original intent
- Successful patterns extracted for reuse

#### 4. Event-Driven Architecture (v2.3.6)
- **Event Queue**: Browser-compatible async event system
- **Fire-and-Forget**: Non-critical operations don't block UI
- **Parallel Processing**: Automatic detection and optimization
- **Loading States**: Required for all async operations
- **Timeout Protection**: All external calls have timeouts
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry with exponential backoff

#### 5. Multi-Agent System
- 9 specialized personas (frontend, backend, security, etc.)
- Clear boundaries and handoff protocols
- Automatic task assignment based on expertise
- Coordinated through orchestration commands

#### 6. Context Engineering
- **Profiles**: Focused work modes (frontend, backend, debug)
- **Bug Tracking**: Persistent across sessions
- **Doc Cache**: Offline documentation access
- **Research Management**: Organize internal analysis/planning docs
- **State Management**: GitHub gist-based persistence

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Project Initialization
```bash
/init-project          # Define project vision
/gi PROJECT            # Generate GitHub issues
```

### 2. Feature Development
```bash
/fw start [#]          # Start from GitHub issue
/prd [feature]         # Create clear specification
/prd-async [feature]   # Add async requirements
/prd-tests [feature]   # Generate test suite
/gt [feature]          # Break into micro-tasks
/pt [feature]          # Process systematically
```

### 3. Quality Assurance

## üéØ Philosophy

**"Vibe Coding"**: You define WHAT to build (strategy), the system handles HOW (implementation).

Core principles:
- Specifications are primary artifacts
- Communication drives development
- Automated enforcement over manual review
- Observable systems over black boxes
- Continuous learning and improvement
- User experience is paramount

## üîÆ Future Vision

This system represents the future of AI-assisted development where:
- Clear communication is the primary skill
- Specifications drive all artifacts
- Quality is automatically enforced
- Knowledge compounds over time
- Teams collaborate seamlessly
- Performance is never sacrificed

The person who communicates most effectively is the most valuable programmer.
