## 🤖 Claude Code Commands

### Essential Commands
- `/sr` or `/smart-resume` - Start here every session
- `/init` - One-time project initialization
- `/help` - See all available commands

### PRD & Task Management (New!)
- `/prd [feature]` - Create Product Requirements Document
- `/gt [feature]` - Generate tasks from PRD
- `/pt [feature]` - Process tasks one by one
- `/ts` - View task status across features
- `/tb` - Visual task board

### Development
- `/cc ui Button` - Create component with validation
- `/vd` - Validate design system compliance
- `/fw start [issue#]` - Start feature from GitHub issue

### Testing & Quality
- `/btf [feature]` - Browser test flow with Playwright
- `/vt` - Verify current task implementation
- `/pp` - Pre-PR validation suite

### Maintenance
- `/auc` - Auto-update CLAUDE.md from codebase
- `/checkpoint create` - Save current state

## 📋 Workflow Examples

### Starting a New Feature
```bash
# 1. Create GitHub issue
gh issue create --title "Feature: User Profile"

# 2. In Claude Code:
/fw start 1                    # Start feature workflow
/prd user-profile             # Generate PRD
/gt user-profile              # Generate task list
/pt user-profile              # Process tasks one by one
/btf user-profile             # Test in browser
/fw complete 1                # Complete and create PR
```

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Morning
/sr                           # Resume where you left off

# During development
/cc ui ProfileCard            # Create components
/vd                          # Validate continuously
/todo add "Add avatar upload" # Track tasks

# Before commits
/qc                          # Quick check
/checkpoint create           # Save state
```

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### 4. Browser Testing Integration
See your features actually work with automated browser testing.

### 5. Zero Context Loss
Every decision, every change, every TODO is tracked and preserved.

### 6. Advanced Observability with Hooks
Track every action, block dangerous commands, save full transcripts for learning.
