## Recommendation:

These appear to be **separate features** from the Next Command Suggestion System:

1. **Branch Management System** - A complete feature for managing branches
2. **Feature Workflow Enhancements** - Improvements to the feature workflow

Since you specifically asked to merge the Next Command Suggestion System, and that's complete, these other features should probably be:

1. **Reviewed separately** to ensure they're production-ready
2. **Committed in separate commits** for clarity
3. **Tested** before merging to main

## Options:

1. **Leave as-is**: The Next Command Suggestion System is already merged. Handle these other features later.
2. **Commit separately**: Create separate commits for branch management and feature workflow enhancements.
3. **Clean up**: Remove these files if they're work-in-progress and not ready for main.
