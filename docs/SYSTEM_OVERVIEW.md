- **Purpose**: Prevent violations from being written
- **Scope**: Individual file operations
- **Feedback**: Immediate blocking/warnings

#### Git Hooks (Commit-Time)
- **When**: During git commit
- **Purpose**: Final validation before version control

## üéØ Philosophy

**"Vibe Coding"**: You define WHAT to build (strategy), the system handles HOW (implementation).

Core principles:
- Specifications are primary artifacts
- Communication drives development
- Automated enforcement over manual review
- Observable systems over black boxes
- Continuous learning and improvement
- User experience is paramount
- One-pass implementation success
- Multi-level quality gates

## üîÆ Future Vision

This system represents the future of AI-assisted development where:
- Clear communication is the primary skill
- Specifications drive all artifacts
- Quality is automatically enforced at multiple levels
- Knowledge compounds over time
- Teams collaborate seamlessly
- Performance is never sacrificed
- Implementation succeeds on first attempt
- Development tools integrate naturally

The person who communicates most effectively is the most valuable programmer.
