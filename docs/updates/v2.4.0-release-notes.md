# Claude Code Boilerplate v2.4.0 Release Notes

## 🚀 Major Enhancements: Smart Issue Creation & Dependency Management

### Overview
Version 2.4.0 addresses critical workflow gaps around context capture, duplicate prevention, and dependency tracking. The system now intelligently captures Claude's analyses for issue creation, prevents duplicate work, and tracks component dependencies automatically.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Smart Capture-to-Issue Command (`/capture-to-issue` or `/cti`)

**Problem Solved**: Manual copy-paste of Claude's summaries and plans into GitHub issues

**Solution**: 
- Captures Claude's response directly to GitHub issues
- AI-powered duplicate detection before creating
- Smart linking to PRDs, parent issues, and current session
- Tracks mentioned components and dependencies

**Example**:
```bash
/cti "Implement caching strategy"
# Checks for similar issues, suggests update or sub-issue creation
```

### 2. Lightweight Dependency Tracking (`/deps`)

**Problem Solved**: Not knowing what components depend on others, breaking changes

**Solution**:
- Uses simple `@used-by` comments in code
- Automatic alerts when modifying shared components  
- Breaking change detection
- No complex manifests - just comments

**Commands**:
- `/deps check Button` - See what uses Button
- `/deps scan` - Update all dependency comments
- `/deps breaking Button` - Check for breaking changes

### 3. Creation Guard Hook

**Problem Solved**: Accidentally recreating existing components

**Solution**:
- Automatically checks if component/function exists before creation
- Shows where it's used and when last modified
- Suggests updating instead of recreating
- Works transparently - no extra commands needed

### 4. Enhanced Response Capture

**Problem Solved**: Losing Claude's analyses and implementation plans

**Solution**:
- Post-tool-use hook captures valuable responses
- Stores summaries, plans, and implementation details
- Easy retrieval for issue creation
- Maintains context between sessions

```

### Configuration Updates:
- Added `dependencies` config section
- Added `capture_to_issue` config section  
- Enhanced hooks configuration
- New GitHub integration settings

### New Aliases:
- `cti` → `capture-to-issue`
- `deps` → `dependency-check`
- `capture` → `capture-to-issue`

## 📊 Impact

### Before v2.4.0:
- ❌ Manual copy-paste for issue creation
- ❌ Duplicate components created unknowingly
- ❌ No visibility into component dependencies
- ❌ Lost context between Claude responses and issues

### After v2.4.0:
- ✅ Direct capture from Claude to GitHub
- ✅ Automatic duplicate prevention
- ✅ Clear dependency visibility
- ✅ Preserved context and relationships

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Capturing Implementation Plans
```bash
Claude: "Here's how we'll implement authentication..."
/cti "Auth implementation plan"
# Creates issue with full context, checks for duplicates
```

### 2. Preventing Duplicate Work
```bash
/cc ui Button
# Alert: Button already exists at components/ui/Button.tsx
# Shows usage in 4 components
```

### 3. Safe Refactoring
```bash
# Before changing Button component
/deps check Button
# Shows: Used by AuthForm, ProfileForm, SettingsPage
# Proceed with caution
```

### 4. Smart Issue Management
```bash
/cti "Bug fix for login"
# Finds related issue #23 "Login problems"
# Suggests adding as comment or sub-issue
```

## 🔍 Configuration

### Enable/Disable Features:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "auto_track": true,
    "alert_threshold": 3
  },
  "capture_to_issue": {
    "similarity_threshold": 0.8,
    "check_by_default": true
  }
}
```

## 📚 Documentation

- Updated `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` to v2.4.0
- Updated `NEW_CHAT_CONTEXT.md` with new commands
- Added `enhanced-workflow-v2.4.0.md` with examples
- Component example with dependency tracking

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Update your clone**:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

2. **Test the new features**:
   ```bash
   # Check dependencies
   /deps scan
   
   # Try capturing an issue
   /cti "Test issue from Claude"
   
   # Check before creating
   /exists Button
   ```

3. **Add to existing components**:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * @component YourComponent
    * @used-by Component1, Component2
    * @depends-on Button, useAuth
    */
   ```

## 🎉 Result

The system now provides:
- **Zero duplicate work** through smart detection
- **Preserved context** from Claude to GitHub
- **Clear dependencies** without complexity
- **Workflow intelligence** that prevents common mistakes

This update makes the system smarter, not bigger - using AI to enhance workflows rather than adding complexity.
