## 🎯 Quick Start Examples

### Create Your First Component
```bash
# 1. Create with validation
/cc Button --with-tests

# 2. Validate design
/vd

# 3. Run tests
/tr Button.test.tsx

# 4. Document
/doc-component Button
```

### Build a Feature with PRP
```bash
# 1. Start from issue
/fw start 123

# 2. Create PRP
/create-prp user-profile

# 3. Execute with validation
/prp-execute user-profile

# 4. Complete
/fw complete
```

### Debug with Visual Tools
```bash
# 1. Capture issue
# Take screenshot

# 2. Analyze
# Ctrl+V in Claude Code
# "Why is this broken?"

# 3. Fix and verify
/btf && /pw-test
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Always Use PRPs for Complex Features
PRPs include everything you need:
- Exact code patterns from your codebase
- Security requirements
- Performance budgets
- Test scenarios

### 2. Validate Early and Often
```bash
/prp-execute feature --level 1  # Syntax
/prp-execute feature --level 2  # Components
/prp-execute feature --level 3  # Integration
/prp-execute feature --level 4  # Production
```

### 3. Let Orchestration Handle Complexity
```bash
# Don't coordinate manually
/orch complex-feature

# Agents work together automatically
```

### 4. Trust the Design System
- Only use allowed font sizes (1-4)
- Only use allowed weights (regular, semibold)
- All spacing must be divisible by 4
- Minimum touch targets 44px

### 5. Leverage Automation
- Git hooks catch issues before commit
- Design validation is automatic
- Tests run on affected code
- Documentation updates itself

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Skipping Validation
```bash
# Bad
/cc Component
# Ship it!

# Good
/cc Component && /vd && /tr
```

### ❌ Manual Coordination
```bash
# Bad
/spawn frontend
# wait...
/spawn backend
# try to merge...

# Good
/orch feature
```

### ❌ Ignoring PRPs
```bash
# Bad
Just start coding...

# Good
/create-prp feature
/prp-execute feature
```
