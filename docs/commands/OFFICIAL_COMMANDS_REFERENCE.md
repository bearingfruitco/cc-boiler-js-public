## Our Command System (150+ Commands)

We extend the official commands with a comprehensive productivity system:

### ðŸš€ Quick Access Commands

/at [task]         # Analyze task, recommend agents
```

#### Development Workflow
```bash
/sr               # Smart Resume - load full context

## Using Official + Our Commands

### Example: Setting Up Sub-Agents

```bash
# Official way
/agents                    # Open agent manager
# Navigate UI to create agent

# Our productivity boost
/spawn pm                  # Use pre-built PM agent instantly
/create-agent my-agent     # Generate new agent with template
```

### Example: Configuring Hooks

```bash
# Official way
/hooks                     # Open hooks configurator
# Manually add hook commands

# Our productivity boost
/enable-hook design-check  # Enable pre-built hook
/ch my-hook               # Create custom hook with template
```

## Command Aliases

We provide short aliases for common commands:

| Full Command | Alias | Purpose |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| `/spawn backend` | `/be` | Backend engineer |
| `/spawn frontend` | `/fe` | Frontend developer |
| `/spawn security` | `/sec` | Security analyst |
| `/validate-design` | `/vd` | Design validation |
| `/smart-resume` | `/sr` | Resume context |

## Best Practices

1. **Use Official for Configuration**
   - `/agents` - When setting up new agents
   - `/hooks` - When configuring hook behavior
   - `/settings` - For core Claude Code settings

2. **Use Ours for Productivity**
   - `/spawn` - Quick agent access
   - `/chain` - Automated workflows
   - `/sr` - Context management
   - Short aliases for speed

3. **Combine for Power**
   ```bash
   /agents          # Set up new agent
   /spawn my-agent  # Use it immediately
   /chain feature   # Run full workflow
   ```

## Migration Guide

### From Official Only
No changes needed! Our commands are additive:
```bash
# Keep using official commands
/agents
/hooks

# Add our productivity commands as needed
/sr              # Better context management
/spawn [agent]   # Faster agent access
/chain [flow]    # Automated workflows
```

### From Our System
You already have everything! Official commands work perfectly:
```bash
/agents          # Manage all 31 pre-built agents
/hooks          # Configure all 25 pre-built hooks
```

## Summary

- **Official Commands**: Core functionality and configuration
- **Our Commands**: Productivity, automation, and shortcuts
- **Together**: A complete development system

Think of official commands as the engine, and our commands as the full vehicle built around it - everything you need for production development.
