    "respect_existing_suggestions": true,
    "decision_guide": {
      "enabled": true,
      "interactive": true,
      "learn_from_choices": true
    },
    "contextual_help": {
      "morning_hours": [6, 10],
      "evening_hours": [17, 22],
      "show_time_based": true,
      "show_bug_alerts": true,
      "bug_alert_threshold": 3
    },

      "suggest_orchestration_threshold": 5,
      "auto_suggest_tests": true
    }
  }
  ```

## ðŸš€ No Additional Activation Required

The system is **fully active** and will:
1. âœ… Automatically provide suggestions after every command execution
2. âœ… Respect existing suggestions from other hooks (no conflicts)
3. âœ… Show contextual help based on time of day
4. âœ… Detect when users are stuck and offer additional guidance
5. âœ… Work with the `/help-decide` command and its aliases

## ðŸ§ª Testing the System

To verify everything is working:

1. **Test a command with suggestions**:
   ```bash
   /cti "Test suggestion system"
   # Should see: ðŸ’¡ Next steps with suggestions
   ```

2. **Test the help-decide command**:
   ```bash
   /hd
   # Should see: Interactive decision guide
   ```

3. **Test time-based suggestions**:
   - Morning (6-10am): Should see morning-specific suggestions with `/sr`
   - Evening (5-10pm): Should see evening suggestions with checkpoint reminders

4. **Test complexity detection**:
   ```bash
   /cti "Research ML approaches for lead scoring"
   # Should suggest: /prp for complex research
   ```

## ðŸ“‹ Hook Execution Order

The suggestion hook runs in the correct order:
1. Command executes
2. Other post-tool-use hooks run (state save, metrics, etc.)
3. **04-next-command-suggester.py** runs
4. Suggestions appear if no conflicts detected

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

Users can customize behavior by editing `.claude/hooks/config.json`:
- Disable suggestions: Set `"enabled": false`
- Change suggestion count: Modify `"max_suggestions"`
- Adjust stuck detection: Change `"stuck_threshold_minutes"`
- Disable time-based help: Set `"show_time_based": false`

## âœ… Compliance with Anthropic Documentation

The implementation follows all official guidelines:
- âœ… Uses stdin/stdout for hook communication
- âœ… Always exits with code 0 (non-blocking)
- âœ… Outputs suggestions to stderr (doesn't interfere with tool results)
- âœ… Respects hook timeout settings
- âœ… Properly registered in both config.json and settings.json

## ðŸŽ‰ System is Ready!

No additional activation steps needed. The Next Command Suggestion System is:
- Fully integrated
- Properly configured
- Ready to guide users through optimal workflows
- Following all official Anthropic Claude Code documentation

Users will immediately see intelligent suggestions after their next command execution!
