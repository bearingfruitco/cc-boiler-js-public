# TDD Automation v3.1 - Issue #7 Implementation Complete ✅

## Issue #7: Auto-TDD for All Features - IMPLEMENTED

### What Was Done:

1. **Updated `/create-component` (cc) Command** ✅
   - Tests are now generated BEFORE any component is created
   - Added mandatory TDD flow with automatic test generation
   - `--no-tdd` flag requires confirmation to skip
   - Includes test examples for rendering, props, interactions, accessibility

2. **Enhanced `/feature-workflow` (fw) Command** ✅
   - Extracts requirements from GitHub issues
   - Auto-spawns TDD engineer to generate test suite
   - Creates tests for all acceptance criteria
   - Blocks implementation until tests exist
   - Added TDD compliance check in validation

3. **Updated `/process-tasks` (pt) Command** ✅
   - Mandatory TDD check before any task implementation
   - Auto-generates tests if missing
   - Shows RED/GREEN phase clearly
   - Enhanced task status indicators for TDD workflow
   - Coverage must stay above 80%

4. **Enhanced `/micro-task` (mt) Command** ✅
   - Even 5-minute tasks get micro-tests
   - Auto-generates appropriate test for the change type
   - Text changes → content tests
   - Style changes → class tests
   - Prop additions → behavior tests
   - `--no-tdd` requires confirmation

5. **Added TDD Configuration** ✅
   - Created `.claude/tdd-config.json`
   - TDD enabled and enforced by default
   - Coverage thresholds: 80% overall, 90% new code, 100% critical
   - Auto-generation enabled
   - Warnings for skipping TDD

6. **Updated `/smart-resume` Command** ✅
   - Shows TDD status on resume
   - Lists components without tests
   - Displays current coverage
   - Includes TDD commands in quick actions

## TDD is Now DEFAULT Everywhere

### Every Code Creation Path Now Has TDD:

```bash
# Component creation
/cc Button
→ Generates Button.test.tsx FIRST
→ Then creates Button.tsx

# Feature workflow
/fw start 23
→ Analyzes issue requirements
→ Generates comprehensive test suite
→ Then allows implementation

# Task processing
/pt user-auth
→ Checks for tests
→ Auto-generates if missing
→ Shows failing tests before coding

# Micro tasks
/mt "Change button color"
→ Creates micro-test
→ Then makes change
```

### Enforcement Mechanisms:

1. **Hooks Block Implementation** - Can't write code without tests
2. **Auto-Generation** - Tests created automatically
3. **Coverage Tracking** - Must maintain 80%+ coverage
4. **Confirmation Required** - `--no-tdd` needs explicit confirmation
5. **Dashboard Visibility** - TDD metrics always visible

### Emergency Escape Hatch:

```bash
# Only for true emergencies/prototypes
/cc QuickPrototype --no-tdd

⚠️  WARNING: Skipping TDD is not recommended!
Confirm: Are you sure? (y/N): _
```

## Impact:

- ✅ 100% of new features will have tests first
- ✅ No manual test writing needed
- ✅ Tests generated from requirements
- ✅ Coverage tracked automatically
- ✅ Regressions prevented
- ✅ Better code design (TDD forces good APIs)

## Next Steps:

The remaining issues (#8-13) can now be implemented:
- Issue #8: Parallel Test Generation
- Issue #9: Intelligent Test Updates
- Issue #10: Live Progress Stream
- Issue #11: TDD Activity Feed
- Issue #12: Test Prioritization
- Issue #13: Auto-Orchestration

TDD is now the DEFAULT and ONLY way to write code in this system!
