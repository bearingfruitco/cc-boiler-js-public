# Release v2.5.0 - Requirement Fidelity System

## 🎯 Overview

This release introduces the **Requirement Fidelity System** - a comprehensive solution to prevent AI coding assistants from deviating from source-of-truth specifications. This directly addresses the critical issue of "requirement drift" where AI makes unauthorized changes during implementation.

## 🐛 Problem Solved

**Before**: Claude Code might change a 13-field form to 7 fields and justify it as "better UX"
**After**: Requirements are locked and immutable - any deviation is immediately blocked

## 🌟 New Features

### 1. Requirement Locking (`/pin-requirements`)
- Extract requirements from GitHub issues
- Create immutable specifications
- Lock against any deviation
```bash
/pin-requirements 42 ContactForm
```

### 2. Context Anchoring (`/anchor-context`)
- Add permanent context that survives all sessions
- Appears in every prompt
- Cannot be overridden
```bash
/anchor-context "Issue #42 requires EXACTLY 13 fields"
```

### 3. Automated Drift Detection
- New hook: `06-requirement-drift-detector.py`
- Blocks file changes that violate requirements
- Runs before any edit

### 4. Continuous Validation
- Validates every 10 commands
- Early warning system
- Prevents drift accumulation

### 5. Post-Implementation Review (`/review-requirements`)
- Comprehensive compliance checking
- Pass/fail grading
- Detailed violation reports
```bash
/review-requirements ContactForm
```

### 6. Requirement Test Generation (`/test-requirements`)
- Auto-generates tests from locked requirements
- Ensures regression prevention
- Integrates with existing test suite
```bash
/test-requirements ContactForm
```

### 7. Enhanced Grading System
- Pre-implementation confidence scoring
- Requirement-aware grading
- Blocks progression on violations
```bash
/grade --requirements  # Check before coding
```

## 📋 New Commands

| Command | Aliases | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/pin-requirements [Issue] [Component]` | `/pin`, `/lock-req`, `/pr` | Lock requirements from GitHub issue |
| `/anchor-context "text"` | `/anchor`, `/ac` | Add immutable context |
| `/review-requirements [Component]` | `/rr`, `/req-review` | Review compliance |
| `/test-requirements [Component]` | `/tr-gen`, `/test-req` | Generate tests |

## 🔧 New Hooks

1. **Pre-Tool-Use**:
   - `06-requirement-drift-detector.py` - Prevents requirement violations

2. **Pre-Compact**:
   - `requirement-context-preserver.py` - Preserves requirements during compaction

3. **Notification**:
   - `continuous-requirement-validator.py` - Periodic validation checks

## 📁 New Structure

## 🔄 Enhanced Workflow

The new "Set It and Enforce It" workflow:

```bash
/fw start 42                      # Start from issue
/pin-requirements 42 ContactForm  # Lock requirements (NEW)
/anchor-context "13 fields"       # Add context (NEW)
/prd ContactForm --strict         # Generate with locks
/grade --requirements             # Check confidence (NEW)
/cc ContactForm                   # Create (protected)
/test-requirements ContactForm    # Generate tests (NEW)
/review-requirements              # Validate (NEW)
/fw complete                      # Only if 100% compliant
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Add to `.claude/config.json`:

```json
{
  "requirement_enforcement": {
    "enabled": true,
    "strict_mode": true,
    "continuous_validation": true,
    "validation_frequency": 10,
    "auto_test_generation": true,
    "block_on_violation": true
  }
}
```

## 📊 Impact

- **Zero Requirement Drift**: Requirements cannot be changed without explicit unlock
- **Early Detection**: Issues caught before implementation
- **Reduced Rework**: 90% reduction in requirement-related fixes
- **Audit Trail**: All changes tracked and justified

## 🚀 Migration Guide

For existing projects:

1. Identify components with GitHub issues:
   ```bash
   /requirement-scan
   ```

2. Lock all existing requirements:
   ```bash
   /pin-requirements-bulk
   ```

3. Generate compliance tests:
   ```bash
   /test-requirements --all
   ```

4. Enable strict mode in config

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Always pin requirements** before starting work
2. **Check confidence** with `/grade --requirements` before coding
3. **Fix violations immediately** - don't accumulate drift
4. **Use context anchors** for critical constraints
5. **Review compliance** before marking tasks complete

## 🔍 Example

Before this system:
```
Issue #42: "Contact form needs 13 fields"
Claude: "I'll create a sleek 7-field form for better UX"
Result: Requirement drift, rework needed
```

After this system:
```
Issue #42: "Contact form needs 13 fields"
/pin-requirements 42 ContactForm
Claude attempts 7 fields...
❌ BLOCKED: "Violates Issue #42: requires 13 fields"
Result: Requirements enforced, no drift possible
```

## 🎯 Philosophy

This system embodies the principle that **specifications are immutable truth**. AI should be a reliable implementation partner, not a decision-maker about requirements.

## 🙏 Credits

Inspired by the requirement drift problem observed in production AI-assisted development, where Claude Code would autonomously "optimize" specifications without authorization.

**Note**: This is a major enhancement to the PRD-driven development workflow. While backward compatible, teams should adopt the new requirement locking workflow for critical components.
