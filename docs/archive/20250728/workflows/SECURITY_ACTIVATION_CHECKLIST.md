- ✅ `pre-deploy-security` - Pre-deployment
- ✅ `secure-form-workflow` - Form creation

### 5. Configuration Files

- ✅ `.agent-os/standards/security.md` - Standards doc
- ✅ Security module in `.claude/config.json`

## 🔄 What Needs Manual Activation

### 1. Environment Variables
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
# reCAPTCHA (required for forms)
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# Redis (optional, for production rate limiting)
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url_here

# Security monitoring (optional)
SECURITY_WEBHOOK_URL=your_webhook_url_here
```

### 2. Package Installation
If using Redis for rate limiting:
```bash
npm install @upstash/redis
```

### 3. Test Hook Installation
Run to verify hooks are working:
```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/test-security-hooks.py
```

### 4. Initial Security Baseline
After setup, run:
```bash
/chain security-baseline
```

## 🚦 Verification Steps

1. **Test Hooks**:
   ```bash
   # Create an insecure API
   /cc api test
   # Should see security suggestions
   ```

2. **Test Commands**:
   ```bash
   /sa --quick
   # Should run security audit
   ```

3. **Test Sub-Agent**:
   ```bash
   /spawn security-auditor --quick
   # Should spawn and analyze
   ```

4. **Check Status**:
   ```bash
   /ss
   # Should show security dashboard
   ```

## 📝 Notes

### Hook Behavior
- Hooks are **non-blocking** - they suggest but don't prevent
- Security warnings appear as messages during development
- Critical issues are highlighted but work continues

### Command Behavior  
- Security commands work like other commands
- Use `--help` flag for options
- Can be chained with other commands

### Sub-Agent Behavior
- Sub-agents run in parallel
- Results integrate with main workflow
- Can be spawned manually or automatically

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Add environment variables** for CAPTCHA
2. **Run security baseline** to establish current state
3. **Start using secure commands** instead of regular ones
4. **Monitor security dashboard** in `/sr`

The security system is now fully integrated and ready to use! All hooks, commands, and workflows are in place. The system will automatically suggest security improvements as you work.
