# Branch Management & Feature Protection Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines how to integrate the proposed Branch Awareness and Branch Management systems into the existing Claude Code Boilerplate without disrupting current functionality.

## Integration Summary

### ‚úÖ Non-Breaking Additions

1. **New Hooks** (No conflicts with existing)
   - `20-feature-state-guardian.py` - Prevents recreating completed features
   - `21-branch-controller.py` - Enforces branch discipline

2. **New Commands** (Complement existing)
   - `/branch-status` (`/bs`) - Branch overview
   - `/feature-status` (`/fs`) - Feature state check
   - `/sync-main` (`/sync`) - Safe main branch sync

3. **New State Files** (Separate namespace)
   - `.claude/branch-state/feature-state.json`
   - `.claude/branch-state/branch-registry.json`

4. **Enhanced Commands** (Backward compatible)
   - `/sr` - Now includes branch awareness
   - `/fw start` - Now checks branch limits and conflicts

### üîß Configuration

Added to `.claude/hooks/config.json`:
```json
{
  "branch_management": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_active_branches": 2,
    "require_main_sync_hours": 24,
    "require_tests_before_switch": false,
    "require_tests_before_new": false,
    "auto_stash_on_switch": true,
    "warn_branch_age_days": 7,
    "block_conflicting_files": true,
    "strict_mode": false
  },
  "feature_protection": {
    "enabled": true,
    "track_completed_features": true,
    "protect_from_recreation": true,
    "require_enhancement_branches": true,
    "warn_on_wrong_branch": true
  }
}
```

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Created feature state guardian hook
- Created branch controller hook
- Added branch-status command
- Added feature-status command  
- Added sync-main command
- Updated hooks config.json
- Added command aliases
- Enhanced smart-resume with branch awareness
- Created initial state files (examples)

### üîÑ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Test Integration**
   ```bash
   # Make hooks executable
   chmod +x .claude/hooks/pre-tool-use/20-feature-state-guardian.py
   chmod +x .claude/hooks/pre-tool-use/21-branch-controller.py
   
   # Test commands
   /branch-status
   /feature-status
   /sync-main
   ```

2. **Populate Initial State**
   - Add your actual completed features to feature-state.json
   - Update branch-registry.json with current branches

3. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Start with `strict_mode: false` (warnings only)
   - Monitor for false positives
   - Adjust rules based on team workflow
   - Enable strict mode when comfortable

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Prevents Lost Work**
- Can't accidentally recreate completed features
- Protected files warn before modification
- Branch conflicts detected proactively

### 2. **Maintains Quality**
- Forces main branch synchronization
- Tracks feature completion status
- Ensures proper enhancement workflow

### 3. **Improves Clarity**
- Always know which branch has what
- Clear feature ownership
- Visible branch limits and rules

## Usage Examples

### Starting New Feature (Protected)
```bash
/fw start 50

# If at branch limit:
üö´ BRANCH LIMIT EXCEEDED!
You have 2 active branches (max: 2)
Complete existing work first.

# If main not synced:
üîÑ MAIN BRANCH SYNC REQUIRED!
Your main is 36 hours old.
Run: /sync-main
```

### Modifying Completed Feature (Protected)
```bash
# Attempting to modify auth component
/cc LoginForm

‚ö†Ô∏è FEATURE STATE PROTECTION!
LoginForm is part of completed feature: user-authentication
Current branch: feature/random-work
Should be on: feature/auth-enhancement

Use: /feature-status user-authentication
```

### Safe Feature Enhancement
```bash
# Check feature first
/feature-status user-authentication

# Shows enhancement branch
üöß Enhancement in progress: feature/auth-mfa

# Switch to correct branch
git checkout feature/auth-mfa

# Now modifications allowed
/cc LoginForm  # ‚úÖ Proceeds
```

## Migration Path

### From Existing Boilerplate
1. No changes needed to existing code
2. Hooks are additive (don't replace existing)
3. Commands are new (don't override existing)
4. State files are optional until populated

### Customization Options
- Adjust `max_active_branches` for team size
- Toggle `strict_mode` for enforcement level
- Disable specific protections if needed
- Customize warning messages in hooks

## Troubleshooting

### If Protection Too Aggressive
1. Set `"enabled": false` for specific hook
2. Or adjust configuration:
   ```json
   "strict_mode": false,
   "critical": false
   ```

### If Files Incorrectly Blocked
1. Check `.claude/branch-state/branch-registry.json`
2. Remove from `blocked_files` section
3. Or run: `/branch-status` to diagnose

### If Branch Limits Too Restrictive
1. Increase `max_active_branches`
2. Or temporarily disable:
   ```bash
   # In config.json
   "branch_management": {
     "enabled": false
   }
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Run `/sync-main` daily
   - Complete features before starting new ones
   - Update feature-state.json after merges

2. **Team Coordination**
   - Share branch-registry.json via git
   - Communicate active branches
   - Review `/branch-status` in standups

3. **Feature Lifecycle**
   - Mark features complete after merge
   - Use proper enhancement branches
   - Document feature ownership

## Conclusion

This integration provides powerful branch and feature protection without disrupting the existing Claude Code Boilerplate workflow. The system is designed to be:

- **Non-invasive**: Only blocks problematic actions
- **Educational**: Explains why and suggests fixes
- **Configurable**: Adjust to team preferences
- **Gradual**: Can start with warnings only

The protection mechanisms ensure that AI agents (and humans) can't accidentally destroy completed work while maintaining development velocity.
