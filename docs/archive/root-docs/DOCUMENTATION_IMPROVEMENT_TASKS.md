## üìù Notes

- Priority levels: HIGH = blocking for v4.0.0, MEDIUM = important but not blocking, LOW = nice to have
- Time estimates are for a single person working focused
- Some tasks can be parallelized if multiple people work on documentation
- Consider using AI assistance for generating command documentation from existing .md files
