# Documentation Improvement Summary

## 📊 Current State Analysis

After reviewing the documentation structure, we've identified several gaps and improvements needed for v4.0.0.

## 🚨 Critical Missing Documentation

1. **Hook System Guide** - Core feature with no dedicated documentation
2. **Command Reference** - 116+ commands without consolidated reference  
3. **API Development Guide** - Next.js 15 patterns undocumented
4. **Testing Strategy** - Fragmented testing documentation
5. **Deployment Guide** - No comprehensive deployment documentation
6. **Monitoring Setup** - No observability documentation

## 📁 Structural Issues

- Root-level files that belong in subfolders
- Empty/redundant folders (`/project/`)
- Summaries and temporary docs mixed with permanent docs
- Some useful content buried in archives
- Inconsistent file naming
