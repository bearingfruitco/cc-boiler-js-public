# v2.7.0 - Agency OS Integration 🎨

*Released: March 2024*

## 🎯 Major Features

### Agency OS Integration
The boilerplate now includes full Agency OS integration, transforming it into a universal operating system for AI coding agents.

#### 🏗️ Centralized Standards System
- **Location**: `.agent-os/standards/`
- **Files**: `design-system.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `best-practices.md`
- **Benefit**: Single source of truth for all development rules
- **Cross-Tool**: Works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and any AI tool

#### 🔌 Drop-in Capability for Existing Projects
New commands for existing codebases:
- `/analyze-existing` (`/ae`) - Comprehensive project analysis and setup
- `/migrate-to-strict-design` (`/mds`) - Automated design system migration
- `/create-prd-from-existing` (`/prd-existing`) - Document existing features

#### 📐 Three-Layer Context Architecture
```
Standards (Global) → Product (Mission/Roadmap) → Specs (Features)
```

### New Commands (Total: 114+)
1. **`/analyze-existing`** - Drop into any existing project
   - Aliases: `/ae`, `/analyze`, `/drop-in`
   - Detects tech stack
   - Creates product documentation
   - Generates migration plan

2. **`/migrate-to-strict-design`** - Convert to strict design system
   - Aliases: `/mds`, `/migrate-design`
   - Analyzes violations
   - Creates backup
   - Auto-migrates code

3. **`/create-prd-from-existing`** - Generate PRD from code
   - Aliases: `/prd-existing`, `/doc-existing`, `/reverse-prd`
   - Analyzes implementation
   - Documents features
   - Identifies improvements

### Enhanced Workflows

#### New Chains
```json
{
  "analyze-existing-project": "Full project analysis",
  "migrate-design-system": "Design migration workflow",
  "onboard-existing": "Complete existing project setup",
  "standards-sync": "Sync with central standards"
}
```

#### Workflow Integration
- Existing projects: `/ae` → `/mds` → `/sr` → normal workflow
- Standards automatically loaded on `/sr`
- Design hook reads from standards files

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Hook Enhancements
- Design check hook can now read from `.agent-os/standards/design-system.md`
- Fallback to hardcoded rules if file missing
- No breaking changes to existing hooks

### File Structure
```
.agent-os/
├── standards/          # NEW: Centralized rules
│   ├── design-system.md
│   ├── tech-stack.md
│   └── best-practices.md
├── product/            # NEW: Auto-generated for existing projects
│   ├── mission.md
│   ├── roadmap.md
│   ├── tech-stack.md
│   └── decisions.md
└── specs/              # Feature specifications
```

### Documentation
- New: `docs/AGENCY_OS_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive integration guide
- New: `.agent-os/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Technical details
- Updated: Main README with Agency OS features
- Updated: Command reference with new commands

## 📊 Benefits

### For New Projects
- Standards pre-configured
- Consistent across all tools
- Ready for team sharing

### For Existing Projects
- Drop-in without disruption
- Automated migration
- Preserves existing work
- Documents current state

### For Teams
- Shared standards repository
- Consistent code across projects
- Reduced onboarding time
- Automated compliance

## 🚀 Migration Guide

### From v2.6.x
No breaking changes. To enable new features:

1. **Update commands**: Pull latest from repo
2. **Create standards**: Customize `.agent-os/standards/` files
3. **Test on existing project**: Run `/ae` on any codebase
4. **Enable enhanced hook** (optional): Test `02-design-check-standards.py`

### Quick Test
```bash
# Test drop-in capability
cd any-existing-project
/ae
/mds analyze
```

## 📝 Notes

- All existing features preserved
- No configuration changes required
- Standards are optional but recommended
- Backward compatible with all workflows

## 🙏 Credits

Agency OS integration inspired by Brian Casel's vision of AI coding agents needing an operating system.
