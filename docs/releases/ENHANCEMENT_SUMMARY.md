# Claude Code Boilerplate Enhancement Summary

## Completed Changes

### ✅ Issue #2: Non-Interactive Mode Support

Successfully added non-interactive mode support to the following commands:

1. **`/stage-validate` (sv)**
   - Added JSON output format
   - Proper exit codes (0 success, 1 failure)
   - Environment variable: `CLAUDE_NON_INTERACTIVE=true`

2. **`/validate-design` (vd)**
   - Structured JSON results for CI/CD
   - Categories: typography, spacing, touchTargets, colorDistribution
   - Exit codes for different failure types

3. **`/prp-execute`**
   - Progressive validation levels (1-4)
   - Detailed test results in JSON
   - Support for `--level`, `--fix`, `--verbose` flags

4. **`/deps` (dependency-check)**
   - Actions: check, scan, update, breaking
   - JSON output with summary and issues
   - Orphaned component detection

5. **`/test-runner` (tr)**
   - Scope-based testing (current, changed, related, all)
   - Coverage reporting in JSON
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines

6. **Created GitHub Actions workflow**
   - `.github/workflows/claude-quality-gates.yml`
   - Shows how to use all non-interactive commands
   - Progressive validation stages

### ✅ Issue #1: Fix Orchestration to Use Native Agents

1. **Updated `/orchestrate` command**
   - Now uses native Claude Code agent invocation pattern
   - Removed custom spawning logic
   - Uses "Use the [agent-name] agent to..." pattern

2. **Updated `/spawn-agent` command**
   - Marked as DEPRECATED
   - Provides migration guide with persona → agent mapping
   - Shows correct usage patterns

3. **Updated `agent-personas.json`**
   - Added `maps_to_native` field for each persona
   - Maps old personas to correct native agents

### ✅ Issue #4: Fix Tool References

1. **Fixed all tool references**
   - Global replacement: `puppeteer` → `playwright`
   - Global replacement: `browserbase` → `playwright`
   - Updated in `agent-personas.json` (6 occurrences fixed)
   - Verified no references in agent files

### ✅ Issue #5: Remove Duplicate Agents

1. **Verified agent list**
   - No duplicate `systems-architect.md` found
   - `integration-specialist.md` already exists
   - All 36 agents have unique names

## Implementation Details

### Non-Interactive Mode Pattern

All commands now follow this pattern:

```python
is_non_interactive = os.environ.get('CLAUDE_NON_INTERACTIVE', 'false').lower() == 'true'

if is_non_interactive:
    # Output JSON
    output = {
        "status": "passed" or "failed",
        "data": {...},
        "exitCode": 0 or 1
    }
    print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    sys.exit(output["exitCode"])
else:
    # Interactive output with colors and formatting
```

### Native Agent Pattern

Orchestration now uses:

```markdown
Use the frontend agent to build the user interface
Use the backend agent to implement the API
Use the qa agent to test the implementation
```

Instead of the old:
```bash
/spawn-agent frontend --task=build-ui
```

### Backward Compatibility

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Interactive mode unchanged
- Spawn commands show deprecation notice but still function
- 6-month transition period for spawn system

## Next Steps

### Remaining Issues:

1. **Issue #3: Smart Chain Auto-Triggers** (Not started)
   - Implement conditional auto-triggering
   - Add prerequisites and error handlers
   - Create chain composition support

2. **Issue #6: Consolidate Security Hooks** (Not started)
   - Merge 3 security hooks into one
   - Maintain same functionality
   - Improve performance

3. **Issue #7: Create Migration Documentation** (Not started)
   - MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
   - CI_CD_SETUP.md
   - CHAIN_AUTOMATION.md
   - NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE.md

## Usage Examples

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Run Quality Gates
  env:
    CLAUDE_NON_INTERACTIVE: true
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  run: |
    claude --non-interactive "/sv check current"
    claude --non-interactive "/vd all"
    claude --non-interactive "/deps scan"
    claude --non-interactive "/tr all unit"
```

### Native Agent Usage

```bash
# Single agent
Use the frontend agent to create a responsive dashboard

# Multi-agent orchestration
/orchestrate complete authentication system with UI and database
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **CI/CD Ready**: All validation commands work in automated pipelines
2. **Unified Agent System**: Single native agent system, no confusion
3. **Correct Tool References**: All tools properly referenced
4. **Better Performance**: Native agents have isolated contexts
5. **Maintainable**: Simpler system with less custom code

The boilerplate is now more aligned with Claude Code's native capabilities while maintaining all the sophisticated features of the original system.
