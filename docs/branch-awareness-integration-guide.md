# Branch Awareness - Proper Integration Guide

## Overview

This is a lightweight, non-disruptive integration that enhances your existing Claude Code Boilerplate with branch and feature awareness.

## What's Different About This Implementation

### ✅ Non-Blocking Approach
- Only shows helpful information, never blocks work
- Respects all existing modes (design-off, TDD, etc.)
- Fails open - if anything breaks, work continues

### ✅ Integrated with Existing Systems
- Uses your event queue for async operations
- Integrates with PRP validation loops
- Enhances existing commands rather than replacing
- Works with your chains and automation

### ✅ Progressive Enhancement
1. **Phase 1**: Information only (current implementation)
2. **Phase 2**: Optional warnings in chains
3. **Phase 3**: Soft protection with clear bypasses

## Components

### 1. Feature Awareness Hook
- **File**: `.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use/20-feature-awareness.py`
- **Purpose**: Shows helpful context when editing completed features
- **Behavior**: Information only, never blocks

### 2. Branch Health Notifications
- **File**: `.claude/hooks/notification/branch-health.py`
- **Purpose**: Periodic tips about branch hygiene
- **Behavior**: Shows every 2 hours max, very lightweight

### 3. Enhanced Commands
- **branch-info**: Lightweight info for chains/automation
- **branch-status**: Detailed view when needed
- **feature-status**: Check feature state

### 4. Event Integration
- **File**: `lib/events/branch-events.ts`
- **Purpose**: Fire-and-forget branch events
- **Integration**: Uses your existing event queue

### 5. PRP Integration
- **File**: `PRPs/branch-awareness-integration.md`
- **Purpose**: Feature awareness in PRP workflow
- **Behavior**: Enhances validation loops

## Usage Examples

### Daily Workflow (No Changes)
```bash
/sr
# Now shows branch info if relevant
# Everything else works the same

/fw start 50
# Works exactly the same
# Might show a tip if at branch limit

/cc LoginForm
# If editing completed feature, shows helpful context
# Edit proceeds normally
```

### Chain Integration
```json
{
  "chains": {
    "morning-aware": {
      "commands": [
        "smart-resume",
        "branch-info --json",
        "conditional:needs_sync:sync-main"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### PRP Enhancement
```bash
/create-prp auth-mfa
# If auth exists, includes context
# Helps avoid recreating working code

/prp-execute auth-mfa
# Validation includes preservation checks
# Ensures no regression
```

## Configuration

All features start disabled or in info-only mode:

```json
{
  "branch_awareness": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "info",  // info|warn|protect
    "show_in_resume": true,
    "notification_hours": 2
  }
}
```

## Migration Path

### From Your Current System
1. **No changes needed** - Everything is additive
2. **Optional adoption** - Use only what helps
3. **Gradual enhancement** - Start with info, add protection later

### Testing
```bash
# See what it does
/sr
# Shows branch info if relevant

# Check feature
/feature-status auth
# Shows if feature exists

# Try editing completed feature
/cc LoginForm
# Shows helpful context, edit proceeds
```

## Benefits

1. **Awareness** - Know when editing completed features
2. **Context** - Understand what already works
3. **Guidance** - Helpful tips, not roadblocks
4. **Integration** - Works with all existing systems

## Important Notes

- **Never blocks work** - Information only in Phase 1
- **Respects modes** - Design-off, TDD, etc. all respected
- **Fails safely** - Any error allows work to continue
- **Progressive** - Can increase protection gradually

## Next Steps

1. **Use normally** - The system enhances quietly
2. **Observe value** - See if the information helps
3. **Adjust as needed** - Enable/disable features
4. **Provide feedback** - What helps, what doesn't

This implementation truly integrates with your sophisticated system rather than fighting it.
