### 🔒 Security Exclusions (Not Synced):

- ❌ API keys and credentials
- ❌ Log files and transcripts
- ❌ Personal captures and screenshots
- ❌ Context state and checkpoint data
- ❌ Team-specific logs and active sessions
- ❌ Git history from .git directory

### 📊 Sync Status:
- **Script Location**: `sync-to-github.sh`
- **Target Branch**: `main`
- **Security**: All sensitive files excluded via .gitignore
- **Process**: 
  1. Switching to main branch
  2. Pulling latest changes
  3. Verifying .gitignore
  4. Removing sensitive files from tracking
  5. Staging all allowed changes
  6. Committing with comprehensive message
  7. Pushing to GitHub

### 🎯 Expected Outcome:
Your complete Claude Code boilerplate system will be available on GitHub's main branch, ready for:
- Team collaboration
- Fresh clones
- Production deployments
- Public sharing (if repo is public)

All while maintaining security by excluding sensitive configuration and state files.

## 📝 Post-Sync Verification:
After sync completes, verify:
1. Check GitHub web interface for pushed changes
2. Confirm no sensitive files were included
3. Verify .claude/ directory is complete
4. Test a fresh clone works properly
