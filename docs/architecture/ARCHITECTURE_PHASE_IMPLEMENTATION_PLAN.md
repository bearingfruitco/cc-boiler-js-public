# Architecture Phase Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan introduces a critical **Architecture Design Phase** between PRD creation and issue generation in the Claude Code boilerplate workflow. This enhancement ensures all projects have proper technical design before implementation begins.

## Current State Analysis

### Problem
- Projects jump from PRD ‚Üí Issues ‚Üí Development
- No systematic architecture design process
- Technical decisions made ad-hoc during development
- Difficult to parallelize work without clear boundaries
- Risk of major refactoring when components don't fit together

### Current Flow
```
/init-project ‚Üí PROJECT_PRD.md ‚Üí /gi PROJECT ‚Üí Issues ‚Üí Development
                                      ‚Üë
                            Missing Architecture Phase
```

## Proposed Solution

### New Flow
```
/init-project ‚Üí PROJECT_PRD.md ‚Üí /create-architecture ‚Üí Architecture Docs ‚Üí /gi PROJECT ‚Üí Issues
                                            ‚Üì
                                    Component PRPs
                                    Technical Roadmap
                                    System Design
```

## Implementation Components

### 1. New Commands

#### `/create-architecture` (Primary Command)
- Analyzes PRD for technical requirements
- Guides through architecture decisions
- Creates comprehensive documentation
- Generates component PRPs
- Produces technical roadmap

#### `/arch` (Alias)
- Short alias for `/create-architecture`

#### `/validate-architecture`
- Checks architecture completeness
- Ensures all components are defined
- Validates technical decisions
- Confirms roadmap clarity

### 2. New Agent

#### `system-architect.md`
Location: `.claude/agents/engineering/system-architect.md`

Responsibilities:
- Translate business requirements to technical design
- Design scalable system architecture
- Define data models and API contracts
- Create security boundaries
- Plan performance optimization
- Generate architecture diagrams (text-based)

### 3. New Chain

#### `architecture-design`
```json
{
  "description": "Complete system architecture from PRD",
  "steps": [
    {
      "command": "analyze-prd",
      "output": "technical-requirements.md"
    },
    {
      "agent": "system-architect",
      "task": "Design system components"
    },
    {
      "command": "create-architecture-docs",
      "output": "Architecture documentation"
    },
    {
      "command": "generate-component-prps",
      "output": "Component PRPs"
    },
    {
      "command": "create-roadmap",
      "output": "TECHNICAL_ROADMAP.md"
    },
    {
      "command": "validate-architecture",
      "output": "Architecture validation report"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Hook Enhancements

#### Pre-Tool-Use Hook: `17-architecture-enforcer.py`
- Prevents issue generation without architecture
- Checks for architecture docs before `/gi PROJECT`
- Suggests `/create-architecture` if missing

#### Post-Tool-Use Hook: `04-next-command-enhancer.py`
- After `/init-project`: Suggests `/create-architecture`
- After `/create-architecture`: Suggests `/gi PROJECT`
- Tracks architecture completion status

### 5. Documentation Structure

```

```

#### Updated `/gi PROJECT`
```python
# Check for architecture docs
if not architecture_exists():
    print("‚ùå Architecture not found!")
    print("Run /create-architecture first")
    exit(1)
```
