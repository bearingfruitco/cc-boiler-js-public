# Architecture Phase Enhancement - Handoff Document

## Context Summary
We identified a critical gap in the Claude Code boilerplate workflow: projects jump directly from PRD creation to issue generation without proper architecture design. This causes ad-hoc technical decisions, difficult parallelization, and frequent refactoring.

## Key Documents Created

### 1. Implementation Plan
**Path:** `/Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/boilerplate/docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_PHASE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Full analysis of the problem
- Detailed solution components
- Review and potential enhancements
- Phased implementation approach

### 2. GitHub Issues List  
**Path:** `/Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/boilerplate/docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_ENHANCEMENT_ISSUES.md`
- 12 GitHub-ready issues
- 4 implementation phases
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Time estimates and dependencies

### 3. Quick Implementation Guide
**Path:** `/Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/boilerplate/docs/architecture/QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- Immediate actions available now
- Manual workaround for current projects
- Minimal enhancement version
- Step-by-step checklist

### 4. Command Stubs Created
**Paths:**
- `/Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/boilerplate/.claude/commands/create-architecture.md`
- `/Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/boilerplate/.claude/commands/arch.md` (alias)

### 5. Fixed Hook Error
**Path:** `/Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/boilerplate/.claude/hooks/post-tool-use/03b-command-logger.py`
- Fixed Python syntax error (indentation in try/except block)
- Same fix needs to be verified in debt-tofu-report project

## Projects Involved

### 1. Boilerplate Project
**Path:** `/Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/boilerplate/`
- This is where the enhancement should be implemented
- All new features go here first
- Test thoroughly before using in other projects

### 2. Debt-Tofu-Report Project  
**Path:** `/Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/debt-tofu-report/`
- Active project that needs architecture design
- Will be first test case for new architecture phase
- Currently has PRD but no architecture

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Implementation (Issues #1-3)
1. **Create Architecture Command System**
   - Implement `/create-architecture` command
   - Add PRD analysis logic
   - Create architecture interview flow
   - Generate documentation templates

2. **Create System Architect Agent**
   - Create `.claude/agents/engineering/system-architect.md`
   - Define capabilities and boundaries
   - Integrate with spawn system

3. **Create Architecture Templates**
   - SYSTEM_DESIGN.md template
   - DATABASE_SCHEMA.md template
   - API_SPECIFICATION.md template
   - FRONTEND_ARCH.md template
   - SECURITY_DESIGN.md template
   - ROADMAP.md template

### Phase 2: Integration (Issues #4-6)
4. **Add Architecture Design Chain**
   - Update `.claude/chains.json`
   - Add `architecture-design` chain
   - Test chain execution

5. **Create Architecture Enforcement Hooks**
   - Create `.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use/17-architecture-check.py`
   - Update existing next command suggestions
   - Block `/gi PROJECT` without architecture

6. **Update Existing Commands**
   - Update `/init-project` to suggest architecture
   - Update workflow documentation
   - Maintain backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Issues #7-9)
7. **Architecture Validation Command**
8. **Architecture Visualization**
9. **Component PRP Auto-Generation**

### Phase 4: Documentation (Issues #10-12)
10. **Architecture Workflow Documentation**
11. **Comprehensive Testing**
12. **Migration Guide**

## For Debt-Tofu-Report Project

### Current Status
- ✅ Project initialized with `/init-project`
- ✅ PRD created (PROJECT_PRD.md)
- ❌ Architecture design missing
- ❌ Issues not yet generated

### Next Steps
1. **Manual Architecture Creation** (until enhancement is ready):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/debt-tofu-report
   /ultrathink complete system architecture for debt relief quiz
   /create-prp system architecture design
   /create-prp database schema design
   /create-prp api architecture design
   /create-prp frontend component architecture
   ```

2. **Create Architecture Docs**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/architecture
   # Then create the architecture documents manually
   ```

3. **Then Generate Issues**:
   ```bash
   /gi PROJECT
   ```

## Quick Start for Next Agent

1. **Review the implementation plan**: 
   ```bash
   /read /Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/boilerplate/docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_PHASE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
   ```

2. **Check the issues list**:
   ```bash
   /read /Users/shawnsmith/dev/bfc/boilerplate/docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_ENHANCEMENT_ISSUES.md
   ```

3. **Start with Issue #1**:
   - Create the `/create-architecture` command
   - Follow patterns from existing commands
   - Test with debt-tofu-report project

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Architecture Required Before Issues**: Enforce via hooks
2. **Component PRPs**: Auto-generate from architecture
3. **Phased Approach**: Don't break existing workflows
4. **Documentation First**: Each component needs docs
5. **Test with Real Project**: Use debt-tofu-report as alpha

## Success Criteria

- Architecture phase seamlessly integrates into workflow
- No breaking changes to existing projects
- Clear value demonstrated in debt-tofu-report
- 90% adoption rate for new projects
- 50% reduction in architectural refactoring

**Remember**: The goal is to ensure every project has proper technical design before implementation begins. This reduces rework, enables parallel development, and improves overall code quality.
