# What's New in Claude Code Boilerplate v4.0.0

> "Automation & Intelligence" - Released July 28, 2025

## üöÄ Major Features in v4.0.0

### 1. **31 Specialized AI Agents** 
The most significant addition - a complete team of AI specialists ready to tackle any development challenge.

**New Technology Specialists:**
- `supabase-specialist` - Database, RLS, real-time features
- `playwright-specialist` - Browser automation, E2E testing
- `analytics-engineer` - Tracking, data pipelines, metrics
- `platform-deployment` - Vercel, edge optimization, CDN
- `privacy-compliance` - GDPR, CCPA, data handling
- `orm-specialist` - Drizzle, Prisma optimization
- `event-schema` - Event design, taxonomy

**Intelligent Orchestration:**
```bash
# Automatic agent selection
/orch payment-system
# Spawns: architect ‚Üí security ‚Üí backend ‚Üí frontend ‚Üí qa

# Manual control
/spawn supabase-specialist
"Design real-time chat schema with RLS"
```

### 2. **Enhanced Chain Automation**
Chains now support conditional logic, prerequisites, and auto-triggers.

**New Features:**
- **Auto-triggers**: Chains suggest themselves based on conditions
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure readiness before execution
- **Multi-phase execution**: Complex workflows with parallel steps
- **Performance monitoring**: Track chain execution times
- **Safe rollback**: Undo capability for all operations

**Example:**
```bash
/chain check
> üîî Suggested chains:
> - morning-startup (first command today)
> - pre-commit (uncommitted changes detected)
> - performance-optimization (slow metrics detected)
```

### 3. **Git Pre-Commit Hooks**
Complementary validation at commit time via Husky.

**What's Validated:**
- Design system compliance (staged files only)
- TypeScript compilation
- Test execution (affected tests)
- Console.log detection
- PRP compliance (if active)

**Performance Optimized:**
```bash
# Only checks what you're committing
git add components/Button.tsx
git commit -m "feat: update button"
# ‚úì Design validation (Button.tsx only)
# ‚úì TypeScript check (Button.tsx only)
# ‚úì Tests run (Button.test.tsx only)
```

### 4. **Native Claude Code Features**
Deep integration with Claude Code's built-in capabilities.

**Visual Debugging:**
```bash
# Quick UI debug
1. Screenshot issue
2. Ctrl+V in Claude Code
3. "Why is this misaligned?"
# Get instant visual analysis
```

**Non-Interactive Mode:**
```bash
# CI/CD automation
claude --non-interactive "/sv check"
claude --non-interactive "/chain deploy"
```

**Multi-Directory Support:**
```bash
# Reference external repos
claude --add ../shared-components .
```

### 5. **Performance Improvements**
15-22% faster across all operations.

**Optimizations:**
- Parallel agent execution
- Smarter file caching
- Lazy loading for commands
- Optimized validation loops
- Faster context compression

### 6. **Accessibility-First Development**
Built-in accessibility enforcement and testing.

**New Commands:**
- `/a11y-test` - Run accessibility audit
- `/a11y-on` - Enable strict mode
- `/a11y-off` - Disable for specific tasks

**Automatic Checks:**
- WCAG AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast ratios

## üîÑ Enhanced Existing Features

### PRP System Improvements

```

### True Test-Driven Development
```bash
/tdd Button
# 1. Generates comprehensive test suite
# 2. Tests fail (RED)
# 3. Implement minimal code
# 4. Tests pass (GREEN)
# 5. Refactor safely
```

### Performance-Driven Development
```bash
/chain performance-optimization-v4
# - Baseline current performance
# - Identify bottlenecks
# - Apply optimizations
# - Verify improvements
# Expect 20%+ performance gains
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience

### Better Error Recovery
```bash
/chain error-recovery
# Automatically:
# - Diagnoses issues
# - Suggests fixes
# - Applies safe corrections
# - Verifies resolution
```

### Smarter Context Management
```bash
/compress
# Now 40% more efficient
# Preserves critical context
# Removes redundancy
# Maintains continuity
```

### Enhanced Debugging
```bash
/debug on
# New debug features:
# - Hook execution trace
# - Command performance
# - Agent decision logs
# - Context usage stats
```
