# 🚀 Building Complex Projects with Claude Code v2.8.0

## Example: Complete Lead Generation System with Analytics Pipeline

This guide demonstrates how the Claude Code system handles comprehensive projects with multiple integrations, showing the full power of TDD, automated testing, and multi-agent orchestration.

## 📋 Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a production-ready lead generation form with:
- Multi-step form with progressive disclosure
- Real-time validation and GDPR compliance
- Supabase database storage
- RudderStack analytics tracking
- BigQuery data warehouse sync
- Complete test coverage and security

## 🏗️ How Your System Handles Complex Projects

### Phase 1: Planning & Architecture

```bash
# Start with the full vision
/create-prd lead-gen-form-with-analytics

"I need a lead generation form that:
- Captures user info (name, email, company, role, interests)
- Has progressive disclosure (multi-step)
- Validates in real-time
- Routes data to Supabase for storage
- Sends events to RudderStack for analytics
- Syncs to BigQuery for data warehouse
- Has GDPR compliance and consent management"

# System generates comprehensive task breakdown
/generate-tasks
# Output: 15-20 tasks covering all aspects
```

### Phase 2: TDD Implementation Flow

The system orchestrates this complex build using specialized agents:

```bash
# 1. Database Architecture (TDD approach)
/pt  # First task: Design data schema
db design lead schema with GDPR compliance fields
# → Creates: Schema design with privacy by design

tdd create database tests for lead storage
# → Writes tests FIRST for:
#   - Data validation rules
#   - GDPR compliance (retention, deletion)
#   - Referential integrity

migrate create lead tables with constraints
# → Implementation that passes tests

# 2. Backend API (Test-First)
/pt  # Next task: Create secure API
tdd create API tests for lead submission
# → Tests for:
#   - Input validation
#   - Rate limiting
#   - Error handling
#   - Security (XSS, SQL injection)

be implement secure lead submission API
# → Builds API to pass all tests

sec audit lead submission endpoint
# → Security verification

# 3. Form UI (Component TDD)
/pt  # Task: Multi-step form
tdd create form component tests
# → Tests for:
#   - Field validation
#   - Multi-step navigation
#   - Error states
#   - Accessibility

form create progressive lead capture form with validation
# → Smart form builder creates advanced form

fe enhance form with design system compliance
# → Ensures UI follows your strict design rules

# 4. Data Pipeline Integration
/pt  # Task: RudderStack integration
tdd create tests for analytics events
# → Tests for:
#   - Event firing
#   - Data structure
#   - Error recovery

be implement RudderStack integration for lead events
# → Integrates with your analytics

# 5. BigQuery Sync
/pt  # Task: Data warehouse sync
tdd create BigQuery sync tests
# → Tests for:
#   - Data transformation
#   - Sync reliability
#   - Schema evolution

auto create n8n workflow for Supabase to BigQuery sync
# → Automation workflow engineer builds the pipeline
```

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Validation

Your system's validation ensures production readiness:

```bash
# Run the full validation chain
/stage-validate check

# This triggers multiple agents:
✓ frontend-ux-specialist: Validates form UX and design compliance
✓ security-threat-analyst: Checks GDPR, data handling, security
✓ qa-test-engineer: Runs full test suite
✓ performance-optimizer: Checks form performance
✓ pii-guardian: Validates PII handling and compliance
```

### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing

```bash
# Browser automation tests
chain browser-test-flow
# → Tests complete user journey:
#   - Form completion
#   - Data storage verification
#   - Analytics event verification
#   - Error scenario handling

# Load testing
perf test form submission under load
# → Ensures system handles traffic
```

## 🎯 System Capabilities for Complex Projects

### 1. **Automatic Test Generation**
```bash
# From your PRD, it generates:
/prd-generate-tests lead-gen-form
# → Creates tests for EVERY acceptance criteria
# → Links tests back to requirements
# → Tracks coverage automatically
```

### 2. **Smart Form Builder Integration**
Your form builder agent knows about:
- Validation patterns (from your field registry)
- Security requirements (from your patterns)
- Analytics needs (tracks everything)
- Accessibility requirements
- GDPR compliance patterns

### 3. **Built-in Security**
```bash
# Automatic security for forms:
/audit-form-security
# → CSRF protection
# → XSS prevention  
# → Input sanitization
# → Rate limiting
# → PII handling
```

### 4. **Data Flow Validation**
```bash
# Validates entire pipeline:
- Form → Supabase (tested)
- Supabase → RudderStack (tested)
- RudderStack → BigQuery (tested)
- Error handling at each step
- Data consistency verification
```

## 📊 What the System Builds

### 1. **Production-Ready Form Component**
```typescript
// Generated with full test coverage
export const LeadGenForm = () => {
  // Multi-step logic
  // Validation rules
  // Analytics tracking
  // Error handling
  // Accessibility
  // GDPR consent
}
```

### 2. **Secure Backend API**
```typescript
// Rate-limited, validated, tested
POST /api/leads
- Input validation ✓
- Rate limiting ✓
- GDPR compliance ✓
- Error handling ✓
- Analytics events ✓
```

### 3. **Complete Data Pipeline**
```

- **form-builder**: Advanced form patterns
- **database-architect**: Optimal schemas
- **automation-engineer**: Integration workflows
- **pii-guardian**: Privacy compliance
- **security-analyst**: Threat modeling

### Integrated Validation
Before anything ships:
```bash

✓ Error scenarios handled
✓ Documentation complete
```

### Real Production Patterns
The system includes patterns for:
- Webhook handling
- Event streaming
- Error recovery
- Data synchronization
- Monitoring & alerting

## 💡 Real Implementation Session

Here's how a typical day would look:

```bash
# Morning: Start and plan
/smart-resume
pm orchestrate lead generation system

# Agent coordinates approach:
"Breaking into phases:
1. Data architecture (2 hours)
2. API development (3 hours)  
3. Form creation (4 hours)
4. Analytics integration (3 hours)
5. Testing & validation (2 hours)"

# Mid-morning: TDD implementation
/process-tasks
tdd implement lead model with tests
# → Red: Write failing tests
# → Green: Implement to pass
# → Refactor: Optimize

# Afternoon: Form development
form create multi-step lead form
fe enhance with animations and transitions
qa create comprehensive form tests

# End of day: Validate progress
/stage-validate check
/checkpoint create lead-gen-day-1

# Next day: Continue
/smart-resume
"Continue with analytics integration..."
```
