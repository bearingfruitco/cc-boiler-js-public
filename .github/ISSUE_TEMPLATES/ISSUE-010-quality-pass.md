## üìã Description

Perform a comprehensive quality review of all documentation to ensure consistency, accuracy, and completeness.

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All documentation follows consistent formatting
- [ ] No broken internal links
- [ ] No spelling or grammar errors
- [ ] Code examples are accurate and tested
- [ ] Cross-references are complete
- [ ] Table of contents are up to date

## üìù Tasks

### 1. Formatting Consistency

- [ ] Ensure all docs have consistent headers:
  ```markdown
  # Title
  
  > Brief description
  
  ## Table of Contents (for long docs)
  
  ## Main Content
  ```

- [ ] Check markdown formatting:
  - Proper use of code blocks with language tags
  - Consistent list formatting
  - Proper line breaks
  - Consistent emoji usage

- [ ] Verify consistent terminology:
  - "Claude Code Boilerplate" (not variations)
  - "v4.0.0" (not v4, 4.0, etc.)
  - Command formatting: `/command` (with backticks in text)

### 2. Link Verification

```bash
# Find all internal links
find docs -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "\[.*\](" {} \; | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "Checking {}" && grep -o "\[.*\]([^)]*)" {}'

# Check for broken links
# Consider using a tool like markdown-link-check
```

- [ ] Fix any broken internal links
- [ ] Update moved file references
- [ ] Ensure relative paths are correct
- [ ] Add missing cross-references

### 3. Spell Check and Grammar

- [ ] Run spell checker on all .md files
- [ ] Review common mistakes:
  - "it's" vs "its"
  - "their" vs "there"
  - Consistent tense (present)
  - Active voice preferred

### 4. Code Example Validation

- [ ] Test all code examples
- [ ] Ensure proper syntax highlighting
- [ ] Check import statements are current
- [ ] Verify TypeScript examples compile
- [ ] Update any deprecated patterns

### 5. Table of Contents Updates

- [ ] Ensure all long documents have TOC
- [ ] Verify TOC matches actual headers
- [ ] Check anchor links work
- [ ] Add TOC to documents missing them

### 6. Cross-Reference Audit

- [ ] Ensure related documents link to each other
- [ ] Add "See also" sections where appropriate
- [ ] Verify navigation flow makes sense
- [ ] Update main README with all major docs

### 7. Final Checklist

- [ ] All TODOs resolved or tracked
- [ ] Version numbers consistent
- [ ] File names follow convention
- [ ] No temporary or WIP content
- [ ] Examples use realistic scenarios
- [ ] Screenshots/diagrams up to date

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools to Use

```bash
# Find TODOs
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|WIP" docs/ --include="*.md"

# Check file naming
find docs -name "*.md" | grep -E "[A-Z]{2,}_[A-Z]{2,}"

# Find large files that might need splitting
find docs -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -rn | head -20
```
