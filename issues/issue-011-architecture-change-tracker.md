# Issue #11: Architecture Change Tracker

## Overview
Implement a system to track and log all changes to the architecture over time, providing a complete history of architectural decisions and evolution.

## Problem Statement
As projects evolve, architectural decisions change. We need:
- A way to track what changed and why
- Version history of architecture documents
- Ability to see architecture evolution over time
- Impact analysis of architecture changes

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Change Tracking**
   - Log all modifications to architecture documents
   - Capture change rationale and impact
   - Link changes to PRPs/features that drove them
   - Track deprecations and migrations

2. **Change Types to Track**
   - New components added
   - Component relationships modified
   - API endpoints added/removed
   - Database schema changes
   - Security policy updates
   - Technology stack changes

3. **Reporting Capabilities**
   - Architecture changelog generation
   - Visual diff of architecture versions
   - Impact reports for changes
   - Architecture decision records (ADRs)

### Technical Requirements
1. **Storage Format**
   - JSON-based change log
   - Git integration for version control
   - Structured change records
   - Searchable change history

2. **Integration Points**
   - Architecture validation command
   - Component PRP generation
   - Documentation system
   - CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Details

### Change Record Structure
```json
{
  "id": "arch-change-001",

### Architecture Change Log
```markdown
# Architecture Changelog

## [2024-01-15] Added Caching Layer
- **Type**: New Component
- **Impact**: Performance improvement
- **Related PRP**: cache-service-prp
- **Changes**:
  - Added Redis cache to system design
  - Updated API gateway to use cache
  - Modified database access patterns

## [2024-01-10] Security Enhancement
- **Type**: Policy Update
- **Impact**: Improved security posture
- **Changes**:
  - Added 2FA requirement
  - Updated authentication flow
  - New security middleware
```

### Command Integration
```bash
# View architecture changes
/architecture-changes

# Generate change report
/architecture-changes --since="2024-01-01"

# Show impact of specific change
/architecture-changes --impact="cache-service"
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All architecture changes are automatically tracked
- [ ] Change history is searchable and filterable
- [ ] Visual diffs available for architecture documents
- [ ] Integration with existing architecture commands
- [ ] ADR generation from change records

## Benefits
1. **Accountability**: Know why decisions were made
2. **Learning**: Understand architecture evolution
3. **Planning**: See patterns in changes over time
4. **Onboarding**: New team members understand history
5. **Compliance**: Audit trail for architecture decisions

## Priority: Medium
Important for long-term project maintenance and knowledge preservation.
