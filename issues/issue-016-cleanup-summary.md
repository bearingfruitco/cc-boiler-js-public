# File Cleanup Summary - Issue #16

> Completed: 2025-07-31T17:00:00Z

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New Structure
- Created `/config/` directory for all configuration files
- Created `/backups/` directory for backup files  
- Created `/archive/` directory for old/deprecated files
- Created comprehensive backup in `/archive/cleanup-backup-20250731/`

### 2. Consolidated Configuration Files
Moved to `/config/`:
- `config.json` → `main.json` (renamed for clarity)
- `aliases.json` (kept as primary)
- `chains.json` (kept as primary)
- `command-registry.json` (kept as primary)
- `feature-flags.json`
- `optimization-config.json`
- `security-config.json`
- `tcpa-config.json` (renamed from tcpa.config.json)
- `tdd-config.json`
- `hooks/config.json` → `hooks-config.json`

### 3. Archived Duplicates
Moved to `/archive/`:
- `chains-enhanced.json` (outdated version)
- `aliases-clean.json`
- `aliases-recommended.json`
- `aliases-recommended 2.json` (had space in filename)
- `command-registry-updated.json`
- `project-config.json` (was a template)

### 4. Moved Backups
Moved to `/backups/`:
- `chains.json.backup`
- `aliases.backup.json`

### 5. Relocated Documentation
- `.claude/docs/*` → `/docs/claude/` (12 files moved)
- `.claude/troubleshooting/*` → `/scripts/claude/` (28 scripts moved)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` → `/docs/claude/`

### 6. Created Documentation
- Created `.claude/README.md` explaining new structure

## Results

### Before
- 27 files in .claude root (many duplicates)
- Confusing file names with "updated", "clean", "recommended"
- Documentation scattered in subdirectories
- Unclear which files were active

### After  
- 11 config files organized in `/config/`
- Clear backup location in `/backups/`
- Old files archived in `/archive/`
- Documentation moved to main project structure
- Single source of truth for each config

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Update any references to old config paths
2. ✅ Test that all commands still work
3. ✅ Remove empty directories
4. ✅ Document the changes

## Files Remaining in .claude Root

These files remain and are appropriate:
- README.md (new - documents structure)
- PRP_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- settings.json
- settings.local.json
- version.json
- verification-manifest.json
- CONFIG_SUMMARY.json

## Issue Status

Issue #16 is now COMPLETE. The .claude directory is cleaned up and properly organized.
