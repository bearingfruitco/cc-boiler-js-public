# Architecture Enhancement Issues

## Overview
These issues enhance the architecture-driven development workflow by adding automation and tracking capabilities to keep everything in sync as projects evolve.

## Issues

### 🔴 High Priority

#### [Issue #10: Auto Documentation Updater Hook](./issue-010-auto-doc-updater.md)
- **Purpose**: Automatically update documentation as code changes
- **Benefits**: Documentation stays current without manual intervention
- **Integration**: Hooks into file changes and updates relevant docs

#### [Issue #12: PRP Regeneration on Architecture Change](./issue-012-prp-regeneration-on-architecture-change.md)
- **Purpose**: Keep PRPs synchronized with architecture changes
- **Benefits**: Implementation plans stay aligned with design
- **Integration**: Triggered by architecture validation

### 🟡 Medium Priority

#### [Issue #11: Architecture Change Tracker](./issue-011-architecture-change-tracker.md)
- **Purpose**: Track and log all architecture evolution
- **Benefits**: Complete history of architectural decisions
- **Integration**: Works with architecture commands

## Implementation Order

1. **First**: Architecture Change Tracker (#11)
   - Foundation for detecting changes
   - Required by PRP regeneration

2. **Second**: PRP Regeneration (#12)
   - Depends on change detection
   - Critical for maintaining alignment

3. **Third**: Auto Documentation Updater (#10)
   - Builds on change tracking
   - Completes the automation loop

## Expected Workflow After Implementation

```bash
# 1. Make architecture changes
/edit docs/architecture/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md

# 2. Validate changes (triggers change tracking)
/validate-architecture
> ✅ Validation passed
> 📝 3 components modified (tracked in changelog)

# 3. Auto-suggested: Sync PRPs
/prp-sync
> 🔄 Updating 3 PRPs affected by architecture changes
> ✅ PRPs synchronized

# 4. Documentation auto-updates in background
> 📚 Updated: docs/components/cache-service.md
> 📚 Updated: docs/api/cache-endpoints.md

# 5. Continue development with everything in sync
/fw start cache-service
```

## Benefits of Complete Implementation

1. **Zero Documentation Drift**
   - Code and docs always match
   - Architecture stays current
   - PRPs remain relevant

2. **Complete Audit Trail**
   - Every architecture decision logged
   - Change rationale captured
   - Impact analysis available

3. **Reduced Manual Work**
   - No manual doc updates needed
   - PRPs regenerate automatically
   - Change tracking automated

4. **Better Team Coordination**
   - Everyone sees what changed
   - Clear migration paths
   - Consistent understanding

## Success Metrics

- Documentation accuracy: 100%
- PRP-Architecture alignment: 100%
- Manual documentation updates: 0%
- Architecture decision visibility: 100%
- Change tracking coverage: 100%

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine requirements
2. Create PRPs for each issue
3. Implement in suggested order
4. Test with real architecture changes
5. Deploy to development workflow

These enhancements complete the architecture-driven development vision where everything stays perfectly synchronized as the project evolves!
