## Files Moved/Modified

### Moved Files:

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Organization**: Each folder has a specific purpose
2. **No Duplicates**: Single source of truth for each topic
3. **Easy Navigation**: Logical structure for finding information
4. **Historical Preservation**: Archive maintains project history
5. **Future Ready**: Structure supports growth

## Verification

- [x] All folders have clear purposes
- [x] No duplicate documentation in active folders
- [x] README.md provides clear navigation
- [x] Archive contains only historical content
- [x] All moved files are accessible
- [x] Cross-references updated

## Next Steps

With folder reorganization complete, the remaining documentation tasks are:
1. **Issue #3**: Restore Archive Content (review what's valuable)
2. **Issue #4**: Version Updates (update to v4.0.0 references)
3. **Issue #7**: Update Roadmap
4. **Issue #9**: Examples and Patterns

The documentation structure is now clean, organized, and ready for the remaining content updates!
