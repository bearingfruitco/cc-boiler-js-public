# Issue #22: Align with Official Claude Code Documentation

## Overview
Update our boilerplate system to fully align with the official Anthropic Claude Code documentation, ensuring compatibility and proper terminology.

## Status: IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

## Key Areas to Update

### 1. Sub-Agents Alignment âœ…
- [x] Verify our agent format matches official YAML frontmatter structure
- [x] Update terminology from "agents" to "sub-agents" where appropriate
- [x] Ensure description fields encourage proactive use
- [x] Verify tools field handling (comma-separated, inherit all if omitted)

**Finding**: Our agents already use the correct format! No changes needed.

### 2. Hooks System Alignment âœ…
- [x] Update hook documentation to match official terminology
- [x] Ensure JSON output format matches official schema
- [x] Add security warnings as per official docs
- [x] Update exit code handling documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive hooks documentation at `docs/hooks/README.md`

### 3. Commands Documentation âœ…
- [x] Document `/agents` command (we use various agent commands)
- [x] Ensure `/hooks` command is documented
- [x] Add any missing official commands
- [x] Created `docs/commands/OFFICIAL_COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md`

### 4. File Structure âœ…
- [x] Verify `.claude/agents/` is the correct location (âœ… confirmed)
- [x] Ensure `~/.claude/agents/` is documented for user-level agents
- [x] Update documentation about precedence rules
- [x] Created `docs/OFFICIAL_CLAUDE_CODE_ALIGNMENT.md`

### 5. Best Practices âœ…
- [x] Add official best practices to our guides
- [x] Update agent generation recommendations
- [x] Add performance considerations
- [x] All incorporated into new documentation

## Progress Log

### 2025-01-31 - Initial Review
1. **Sub-Agents Format**: âœ… Already correct!
   - Our agents use proper YAML frontmatter
   - Description fields are detailed
   - Tools specification matches

2. **Hooks System**: Needs minor updates
   - Our hooks work correctly but docs need alignment
   - Security warnings should be more prominent

3. **Commands**: Need to document official commands
   - We have many custom commands but should reference official ones

## Action Items

### Immediate Updates Needed

1. **Update Agent Documentation**

   # Add note about /agents command
   # Reference official docs
   ```

   ```

## Files to Update

1. `.claude/agents/AGENT_USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Update terminology
2. `.claude/hooks/README.md` - Add if missing, align with official
3. `docs/commands/OFFICIAL_COMMANDS.md` - Create new file
4. `CLAUDE.md` - Add references to official docs

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All agent files use correct YAML format
- [ ] Hook scripts follow official JSON output schema
- [ ] Documentation references official terms

## Notes

Our system is already very well-aligned with the official documentation! The main updates needed are:
1. Terminology updates (agents â†’ sub-agents)
2. Adding references to official commands
3. Making security warnings more prominent
4. Documenting how our extensions complement the official features

The core functionality is already compatible - this is mostly documentation updates.
