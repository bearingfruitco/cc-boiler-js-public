# Issue #12: PRP Regeneration on Architecture Change - Implementation Summary

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Built

### 1. PRP Regenerator System (`/lib/prp-regenerator/`)

#### Components Created:
- **types.ts**: Comprehensive type definitions for PRP regeneration
- **parser.ts**: PRP content parser with preservation logic
- **generator.ts**: PRP content generator with architecture integration
- **regenerator.ts**: Main regeneration engine
- **cli.ts**: Interactive command-line interface
- **index.ts**: Module exports
- **README.md**: Complete documentation

### 2. Features Implemented

#### Smart Content Analysis
- Parse existing PRPs to extract structure
- Identify completed tasks (checkboxes)
- Extract custom sections and notes
- Preserve implementation progress

#### Architecture Change Integration
- Connects with Architecture Tracker (Issue #11)
- Maps architecture changes to affected PRPs
- Calculates impact and priority
- Detects outdated PRPs automatically

#### Intelligent Regeneration
- Only updates affected sections
- Preserves checkbox completion status
- Maintains custom content
- Adds clear change markers
- Creates backups before modification

#### Change Notification
- Visual banners showing updates
- Lists specific architecture changes
- Marks modified sections with 🔄
- Links to architecture changelog

### 3. CLI Commands

```bash
# Check sync status
./scripts/prp-sync.sh status

# Analyze impact
./scripts/prp-sync.sh analyze [--since date]

# Update PRPs interactively
./scripts/prp-sync.sh update

# Update all PRPs
./scripts/prp-sync.sh update-all

# Full synchronization
./scripts/prp-sync.sh sync-all

# Preview changes (dry run)
./scripts/prp-sync.sh dry-run

# Restore from backup
./scripts/prp-sync.sh restore <prp-file>
```

### 4. Integrated Workflow

Created `architecture-prp-workflow.sh` for seamless integration:

```bash
# Record change and sync PRPs
./scripts/architecture-prp-workflow.sh record-and-sync

# Analyze everything
./scripts/architecture-prp-workflow.sh analyze-all

# Full synchronization
./scripts/architecture-prp-workflow.sh full-sync

# Component impact analysis
./scripts/architecture-prp-workflow.sh impact <component>

# Validate alignment
./scripts/architecture-prp-workflow.sh validate
```

## Example: Updated PRP

When architecture changes, PRPs are updated with clear markers:

```markdown
# PRP: Authentication Service

> ⚠️ **Architecture Updated**: 2024-07-31
> - ADDED: OAuth2 provider integration required
> - MODIFIED: Session storage moved to Redis
> - REMOVED: Local session management deprecated
> - See [architecture changelog](../docs/architecture/CHANGELOG.md)

## Overview
This Project Requirements Plan (PRP) defines the implementation requirements for the **authentication-service** component.

### Recent Architecture Updates
This PRP has been regenerated to reflect recent architecture changes. Please review the changes in the Architecture Changes section below.

## Technical Context 🔄
[Updated with new dependencies and integrations]

## Architecture Changes 🔄

### ➕ Added: OAuth2 Integration
**Description**: OAuth2 provider integration required
**Impact**: 
- authentication-service
- api-gateway
**Action Required**: Implement new functionality to support this addition

### 🔄 Modified: Session Storage
**Description**: Session storage moved to Redis
**Impact**:
- authentication-service
- session-handler
**Action Required**: Update existing implementation to match new requirements

## Implementation Order
- [x] Create directory structure ✓ (preserved)
- [x] Define TypeScript types ✓ (preserved)
- [ ] Set up basic module structure
- [ ] Implement OAuth2 integration (NEW)
- [ ] Migrate session storage to Redis (UPDATED)
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. Automatic Synchronization
- No more outdated PRPs
- Architecture changes automatically reflected
- Developers always have current requirements

### 2. Progress Preservation
- Completed work is never lost
- Custom sections maintained
- Implementation notes preserved
- Team effort respected

### 3. Clear Communication
- Visual indicators for changes
- Detailed change descriptions
- Links to architecture decisions
- Action items highlighted

### 4. Workflow Integration
- Seamless with Architecture Tracker
- CLI tools for automation
- Dry-run for safety
- Backup system for recovery

## Integration with Issue #11

The PRP Regenerator builds on the Architecture Tracker:

```typescript
// Architecture change recorded
await architectureTracker.recordChange({
  type: ArchitectureChangeType.COMPONENT_MODIFIED,
  component: 'authentication-service',
  description: 'Added OAuth2 integration',
  // ...
});

// PRPs automatically analyzed
const tasks = await prpRegenerator.analyzeImpact();
// Output: authentication-service-prp.md needs update

// Regenerate with preservation
await prpRegenerator.regeneratePRP(tasks[0], {
  preserveProgress: true,
  preserveCustomSections: true,
  addChangeMarkers: true
});
```

## Testing the Implementation

To test the PRP regenerator:

```bash
# 1. Check current status
./scripts/prp-sync.sh status

# 2. Create a test architecture change
./scripts/architecture-tracker.sh record

# 3. Analyze impact on PRPs
./scripts/prp-sync.sh analyze

# 4. Update PRPs (dry run first)
./scripts/prp-sync.sh dry-run

# 5. Perform actual update
./scripts/prp-sync.sh update
```

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Architecture changes trigger PRP analysis
✅ Only affected PRPs are regenerated
✅ Progress and customizations are preserved
✅ Clear change notifications in PRPs
✅ Rollback capability via backups

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Completed PRPs**: Warns when updating completed PRPs
2. **Major Changes**: Supports full regeneration when needed
3. **Missing PRPs**: Identifies components without PRPs
4. **Merge Conflicts**: Backups allow recovery
5. **Custom Content**: Preserves non-standard sections

## Next Steps

With both Issue #11 and #12 complete, the architecture-PRP synchronization system is fully operational. This enables:

1. Confident architecture evolution
2. Always-current implementation plans
3. Preserved developer progress
4. Clear change communication

The system is ready for production use and will maintain alignment between architecture decisions and implementation plans as the project evolves.
