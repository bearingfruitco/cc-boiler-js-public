# PRP: Integrate Advanced Claude Code Features & Octocode MCP

> **Enhance our system with parallel agents, validation gates, hooks, and Octocode MCP while maintaining compatibility**

## 🎯 Goal
Integrate advanced Claude Code features from Cole Medin's guide and add Octocode MCP for intelligent code generation, ensuring no conflicts with our existing TDD and testing infrastructure.

## 🔑 Why This Matters
- **User Value**: 3x faster development with parallel agents
- **Business Value**: Higher quality code with validation gates
- **Technical Value**: Automated workflows reduce manual work
- **Code Generation**: Octocode MCP for intelligent code assistance

## ⚠️ Critical Compatibility Requirements
- **DO NOT** override our existing TDD-engineer agent
- **DO NOT** conflict with existing test commands
- **ENSURE** validation-gates complements TDD, not replaces it
- **MAINTAIN** our existing 35+ agents functionality
- **PRESERVE** our MCP registry structure
- **ENHANCE** claw.md without breaking existing rules

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] Parallel agent development working with 3+ agents
- [ ] Validation gates runs AFTER TDD tests
- [ ] Octocode MCP integrated and accessible
- [ ] Hooks system working without conflicts
- [ ] GitHub CLI integration operational
- [ ] All existing agents still functional
- [ ] No test command conflicts
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 📚 Required Context

### Current System Analysis
```yaml
existing_testing:
  - tdd-engineer: Test-first development
  - qa: Quality assurance
  - playwright-specialist: E2E testing
  
new_additions:
  - validation-gates: Post-implementation validation
  - octocode-mcp: Code generation assistance
  
compatibility_strategy:
  - TDD remains primary for new features
  - Validation gates for final verification
  - Clear separation of concerns
```

### Octocode MCP Integration
- Repository: https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp
- Purpose: Intelligent code generation and refactoring
- Integration: Add to our MCP registry

## 🏗️ Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Install Octocode MCP
```bash
# Add Octocode to MCP servers
claude mcp add octocode

# Update MCP registry
{
  "octocode-mcp": {
    "name": "Octocode MCP",
    "url": "https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp",
    "capabilities": [
      "code:generate",
      "refactor:suggest",
      "patterns:apply",
      "best-practices:enforce"
    ],
    "priority": "P1"
  }
}

# Update agent mappings
- senior-engineer: Add octocode-mcp
- refactoring-expert: Add octocode-mcp
- backend: Add octocode-mcp (optional)
- frontend: Add octocode-mcp (optional)
```

### Task 2: Create Validation Gates Agent (Complementary to TDD)
```yaml
# .claude/agents/validation-gates.md
name: validation-gates
description: |
  Post-implementation validation specialist. Works AFTER tdd-engineer.
  Ensures code meets production standards beyond unit tests.
  Focuses on integration, performance, and edge cases.
  
hierarchy:
  1. tdd-engineer writes tests first
  2. Implementation happens
  3. validation-gates ensures production readiness
  
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash]
```

### Task 3: Implement Parallel Agent System
```bash
# Create parallel commands
.claude/commands/
├── prep-parallel.md      # Setup work trees
├── execute-parallel.md   # Run multiple agents
├── merge-best.md         # Merge best solution
└── cleanup-parallel.md   # Clean work trees

# Add work trees directory
mkdir -p .trees
echo ".trees/" >> .gitignore
```

### Task 4: Setup Hooks System (Non-Intrusive)
```json
// .claude/config/hooks.json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "name": "post-implementation-validation",
      "type": "after_agent_use",
      "matcher": { "agent": "tdd-engineer" },
      "command": "echo 'TDD complete. Consider /validate for production checks'"
    },
    {
      "name": "log-code-changes",
      "type": "after_tool_use",
      "matcher": { "tool": "str_replace_editor" },
      "command": "bash .claude/hooks/log-changes.sh"
    },
    {
      "name": "security-check",
      "type": "after_file_creation",
      "command": "bash .claude/hooks/security-scan.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Task 5: Enhance claw.md (Additive, Not Replacement)
```markdown
# Append to existing claw.md

## Parallel Development Guidelines
When using parallel agents:
- Each agent works in isolated work tree
- Follow existing patterns and design system
- Merge conflicts resolved by lead agent

## Testing Hierarchy
1. TDD-first for new features (tdd-engineer)
2. Unit tests must pass
3. Integration tests via qa agent
4. Final validation via validation-gates
5. Performance checks if needed

## Octocode Integration
- Use for code generation suggestions
- Verify generated code meets our standards
- Always validate with tests
```

### Task 6: GitHub CLI Integration
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Create GitHub automation commands
.claude/commands/
├── fix-github-issue.md   # Auto-fix issues
├── create-pr.md          # Smart PR creation
└── review-pr.md          # Automated PR review
```

### Task 7: Create Integration Tests
```bash
# Test parallel agents don't conflict
/test-parallel-agents

# Test validation gates works with TDD
/test-tdd-validation-flow

# Test Octocode generates valid code
/test-octocode-generation

# Test hooks don't break existing flows
/test-hooks-compatibility
```

## 🧪 Validation Plan

### Compatibility Tests
```bash
# 1. Verify existing agents work
for agent in .claude/agents/*.md; do
  /test-agent $(basename $agent .md)
done

# 2. Test TDD flow still works
/tdd-engineer "test feature"
# Ensure normal flow

# 3. Test validation gates complements TDD
/tdd-engineer "feature"
/validation-gates "feature"
# Should enhance, not replace

# 4. Test parallel doesn't break main
/prep-parallel "test" 3
/execute-parallel "test" "plan.md" 3
# Verify main branch unchanged
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Full workflow test
1. Create issue in GitHub
2. /fix-github-issue 1
3. Verify TDD runs first
4. Verify validation gates runs after
5. Verify PR created
```

## 📊 Success Metrics
- **No Breaking Changes**: 0 existing features broken
- **Speed Improvement**: 3x with parallel agents
- **Quality Improvement**: 20% fewer bugs with validation gates
- **Automation Level**: 80% of issues auto-fixable
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained at 80%+

## 🚫 What NOT to Do
- Don't replace TDD with validation gates
- Don't let parallel agents modify main branch directly
- Don't auto-merge without review
- Don't skip existing test requirements
- Don't override existing agent behaviors

## 📝 Rollback Plan
If any conflicts arise:
1. Git stash changes
2. Restore from .claude/backups/
3. Incrementally add features
4. Test each addition thoroughly

## 🎯 Final Checklist
- [ ] All 35+ existing agents still work
- [ ] TDD flow unchanged
- [ ] Validation gates adds value, not confusion
- [ ] Parallel agents isolated properly
- [ ] Octocode MCP integrated
- [ ] Hooks non-intrusive
- [ ] Documentation clear
- [ ] No test conflicts
