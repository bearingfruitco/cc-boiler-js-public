# PRP: Integrate Advanced Claude Code Features & Octocode MCP

> **Carefully integrate parallel agents, validation gates, hooks, Octocode MCP, and claw.md while preserving our existing system**

## üéØ Goal
Enhance our Claude Code system with advanced features from Cole Medin's guide and Octocode MCP, while ensuring compatibility with our existing 35+ agents, 50+ commands, and TDD approach.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Constraints
- **DO NOT** overwrite existing agents or commands
- **DO NOT** conflict with our TDD-engineer agent
- **DO NOT** break our existing MCP mappings
- **PRESERVE** our current workflow system
- **ENHANCE** rather than replace

## üîë Why This Matters
- **User Value**: 3x faster development with parallel agents
- **Business Value**: Automatic quality assurance reduces bugs
- **Technical Value**: Octocode MCP provides intelligent code generation

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] Octocode MCP connected and operational
- [ ] Parallel agent system working without breaking existing agents
- [ ] Validation-gates complements (not replaces) TDD-engineer
- [ ] claw.md works alongside CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Hooks enhance without disrupting workflows
- [ ] All existing features still work
- [ ] No configuration conflicts

## üìö Required Context

### Current System Analysis
```
EXISTING:
- 35+ specialized agents (including tdd-engineer)
- 50+ custom commands
- 18 MCPs configured
- CLAUDE.md (not claw.md)
- Comprehensive workflow system

NEW TO ADD:
- Octocode MCP for code generation
- Parallel agent development (git worktrees)
- Validation-gates agent (complements TDD)
- claw.md for Claude Code compatibility
- Hooks system for automation
- Enhanced GitHub CLI commands
```

### Integration Strategy
1. **Octocode MCP**: Add as optional MCP for code-generation agents
2. **Validation Gates**: Works AFTER tdd-engineer, not instead of
3. **claw.md**: Create alongside CLAUDE.md, reference shared docs
4. **Parallel Agents**: New commands that don't conflict
5. **Hooks**: Additive automation, not replacement

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Install and Configure Octocode MCP
```bash
# Install Octocode MCP
npm install -g octocode-mcp
claude mcp add octocode

# Update mcp-registry.json
{
  "octocode-mcp": {
    "name": "Octocode MCP",
    "url": "https://github.com/bgauryy/octocode-mcp",
    "capabilities": [
      "code:generate",
      "refactor:suggest",
      "patterns:apply",
      "ai:enhance"
    ],
    "priority": "P1"
  }
}

# Update relevant agents to use Octocode
# senior-engineer, refactoring-expert, code-reviewer
```

### Task 2: Create claw.md (Claude Code compatibility)
```markdown
# .claude/claw.md
---
description: Claude Code specific configuration
---

# Claude Code Configuration

This file provides Claude Code compatibility while maintaining our existing CLAUDE.md system.

## Reference Documents
- Main configuration: ../CLAUDE.md
- Workflows: .claude/docs/WORKFLOWS.md
- Design system: .claude/docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md

## Claude Code Specific Settings
- Use Octocode MCP for enhanced code generation
- Invoke validation-gates after tdd-engineer
- Follow our established patterns

## Integration with Existing System
All rules in CLAUDE.md apply. This file adds Claude Code specific enhancements.
```

### Task 3: Implement Testing Harmony (TDD + Validation)
```markdown
# Testing Strategy

## TDD-Engineer (FIRST)
- Writes tests before implementation
- Follows red-green-refactor
- Creates test structure

## Validation-Gates (SECOND)
- Runs after implementation
- Adds missing test cases
- Ensures 80%+ coverage
- Validates performance
- Checks accessibility

## Workflow
1. tdd-engineer writes initial tests
2. Implementation happens
3. validation-gates ensures completeness
4. Both agents collaborate, not compete
```

### Task 4: Add Parallel Agent Commands (Non-Conflicting)
```bash
# New commands that don't override existing ones
.claude/commands/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ parallel-prep.md      # (new)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ parallel-execute.md   # (new)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ parallel-merge.md     # (new)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [existing 50+ commands remain]

# Work trees in separate directory
.trees/  # Isolated from main project
```

### Task 5: Implement Hooks System (Additive)
```json
// .claude/config/hooks.json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "type": "after_agent_use",
      "matcher": {"agent": "tdd-engineer"},
      "command": "echo 'TDD tests written, ready for implementation'"
    },
    {
      "type": "after_agent_use", 
      "matcher": {"agent": "validation-gates"},
      "command": "bash .claude/hooks/log-validation.sh"
    },
    {
      "type": "after_tool_use",
      "matcher": {"tool": "octocode_generate"},
      "command": "echo 'Octocode generation complete'"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Task 6: Update Agent MCP Mappings for Octocode
```yaml
# Update these agents to include Octocode MCP:

senior-engineer:
  optional:
    - octocode-mcp  # AI-enhanced code generation

refactoring-expert:
  required:
    - octocode-mcp  # Intelligent refactoring

code-reviewer:
  optional:
    - octocode-mcp  # Code pattern analysis
```

### Task 7: Create Integration Tests
```bash
# Test that everything works together
npm test

# Specific integration tests:
- Octocode MCP connects
- Parallel agents don't break existing ones
- TDD and validation work together
- Hooks trigger correctly
- claw.md doesn't conflict with CLAUDE.md
```

## üß™ Validation Plan

### Phase 1: Compatibility Testing
```bash
# Verify existing features still work
/test-all-agents
/test-all-commands
/mcp-status

# All should pass before proceeding
```

### Phase 2: New Feature Testing
```bash
# Test Octocode
/test-mcp octocode-mcp

# Test parallel agents
/parallel-prep "test-feature" 2
/parallel-execute "test-feature" "test-plan.md" 2

# Test validation gates
/use validation-gates
```

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
```bash
# Test TDD + Validation together
/use tdd-engineer
# Then automatically trigger validation-gates

# Test hooks
# Make a change and verify hook fires
```

## üìä Success Metrics
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing features work
- **Octocode Success**: Generates better code 
- **Parallel Speed**: 3x faster with 3 agents
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ with validation gates
- **Hook Automation**: 50% less manual work

## üö´ Risk Mitigation

### Potential Conflicts & Solutions

| Risk | Solution |
|------|----------|
| TDD vs Validation conflict | Clear separation: TDD first, validation second |
| claw.md vs CLAUDE.md | claw.md references CLAUDE.md, doesn't replace |
| Parallel agents break main | Use .trees/ isolation |
| Octocode conflicts | Make it optional, not required |
| Hooks interfere | Start with logging only, add automation gradually |

## üìù Rollback Plan
If any integration causes issues:
1. Remove hooks.json
2. Disconnect Octocode MCP
3. Remove parallel commands
4. Keep validation-gates (it's additive)
5. Remove claw.md

All changes are additive and reversible.

## üéØ Implementation Order
1. **Day 1**: Add Octocode MCP (low risk)
2. **Day 2**: Add validation-gates agent (complements TDD)
3. **Day 3**: Add claw.md (references CLAUDE.md)
4. **Day 4**: Add parallel agent commands
5. **Day 5**: Add hooks system (start simple)
6. **Day 6**: Integration testing
7. **Day 7**: Documentation and training

## üìö Documentation Updates Required
- Update MCP_AGENT_MAPPING.md with Octocode
- Add PARALLEL_DEVELOPMENT.md guide
- Update TESTING_STRATEGY.md for dual approach
- Create HOOKS_GUIDE.md
- Update README with new capabilities

## ‚ú® Expected Outcome
An enhanced Claude Code system that:
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Adds powerful new capabilities
- Increases development speed 3x
- Improves code quality automatically
- Works harmoniously with our current setup
